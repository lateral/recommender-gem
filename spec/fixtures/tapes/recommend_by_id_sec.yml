        destiny services are\\nbased around proprietary security, watermarking and
        playerless streaming media\\ntechnologies. \\ncurrently, more than 97% of
        the company\u0092s revenues come from\\nthe play mpe\u00ae digital distribution
        service, which the recording industry uses to\\ndistribute new pre-release
        music and music videos to trusted recipients before\\nthat content is generally
        available for sale to the public. \\nthe remaining 3% of revenue is generated
        from sales of video\\nproducts branded as clipstream\u00ae, a playerless streaming
        video solution. the\\nmajority of clipstream\u00ae revenue is derived from
        a new technology, also branded\\nas clipstream\u00ae. \\nclipstream\u00ae
        \\nclipstream\u00ae products are based on a technology which provides\\nstreaming
        video through the internet directly on to the variety of devices and\\nbrowers.
        clipstream\u00ae\u0092s \u0093encode once, play anywhere\u0094 vision addresses
        the breadth\\nand complexity in today\u0092s multi-format video environment,
        reducing the cost and\\ncomplexity of delivering streaming video. this single
        format solution can be\\nsold into any customer landscape and industry vertical
        requiring streaming\\nvideo. \\nthe company is developing products under the
        clipstream\u00ae brand\\nthat include the core engine technology, a cloud
        encoding and hosting service,\\nan enhanced security plug-in and variants
        of these solutions for market research\\nand a advertising industry verticals.
        the company has had some initial revenue\\nfrom the market research video
        questionnaire service. \\ncompeting solutions deliver video through a variety
        of formats: flash, and\\nhtml 5 <video> tag formats, predominately either
        h.264, h.265 or web m.\\nthis variety of formats has created a number of problems
        for video publishers:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. \\n\\nto reach a wide audience, video
        providers have to\\n      \u0093transcode\u0094, or convert, the source video
        format into a number of third\\n      party formats. transcoding is costly,
        time consuming, creates additional\\n      costs for storage and hosting,
        and can involve considerable human touch to\\n      keep everything in check.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n2.
        \\n\\nnew html 5 video formats do not offer native security.\\n      the content
        is in an unencrypted format that is easily\\n  copied.\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n3.
        \\n\\nfor many industry verticals, such as advertising, video\\n      \u0093interactivity\u0094
        and tracking of activity are necessary features. new\\n      device formats
        reliant on html 5 do not offer native\\n  interactivity.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n4.
        \\n\\nsource formats are often served by proprietary streaming\\n      video
        servers, where each viewer has a unique standalone connection to the\\n      server.
        unlike standard http web content, this inefficient delivery method\\n      can
        increase hosting and infrastructure costs by multiple\\n  times.\\nclipstream\u00ae
        has a solution to these challenges by offering a\\nsecure, single-format,
        playerless, multi-platform video technology served from a\\nrobust content
        delivery network. clipstream\u00ae video requires only one video\\nformat
        to reach mobile devices, mac os, pc, ios and android. clipstream\u00ae video\\nhas
        native security advantages that enable content owners to lock content to\\nservers
        and make copying difficult. clipstream\u00ae video operates as a javascript\\nscreen
        element that can be fully integrated into tracking and interactive\\nelements
        by advertisers, designers and web applications developers. all of this\\ncan
        be served on a standard http web server, allowing publishers to reap cost\\nand
        labor savings. \\nthe company intends to focus on three to four primary business\\nverticals
        in the coming twelve months, including market research & survey,\\nadvertising
        and government & education. another key focus will be the\\nopportunity to
        license the core clipstream\u00ae engine. this will be approached\\nthrough
        technology and commercial partnerships and based upon a \u0091royalty\u0092\\nlicensing
        model. the current offerings are all available as a \u0093software as a\\nservice\u0094
        although in the future the company may choose a variety of licensing\\noptions
        to suit industry verticals and or customer and competitive requirements.\\n\\nplay
        mpe\u00ae \\nplay mpe\u00ae is a digital delivery service for securely moving\\nbroadcast
        quality audio, video, images, promotional information and other\\ndigital
        content securely through the internet. the system is currently used by\\nthe
        recording industry for transferring pre-release broadcast quality music,\\nradio
        shows, and music videos to trusted recipients such as radio stations,\\nmedia
        reviewers, vip\u0092s, dj\u0092s, film and tv personnel, sports stadiums and\\nretailers.
        the system replaces the physical distribution (mail, courier or hand\\ndelivery)
        of cd\u0092s. the financial model is transaction based, where the price per\\ndelivery
        varies with the number of songs and videos in the package. \\nrecord labels
        around the world, including all three major\\nlabels (universal music group
        (\u0093umg\"), warner music group and sony music\\nentertainment), are regularly
        using play mpe\u00ae to deliver their content to radio.\\n\\neach distribution
        is initiated by our customers, who \u0093encode\u0094\\nthe content and enter
        the appropriate data. our software has a tiered\\npermissions based access
        allowing our clients to assign varying rights,\\ncapabilities and responsibilities
        to different members of their staff. for\\nexample, some customer staff may
        manage assets (album cover imagery, music\\nvideos, the raw music, promotional
        information and other metadata), while others\\nmanage hierarchical permission
        based lists of recipients. larger labels are\\nnormally structured into label
        groups, each with their own labels with varying\\naccess (permissions) to
        various subsets of the master recipient lists. \\nthe release dates for music
        can be dependent on the territory\\nand, where administrative settings permit,
        local promotions staff will generate\\na localized distribution of the song
        with modified marketing information in the\\nlocal language. local staff will
        select pre-existing assets from the system and\\ncombine them together with
        local recipient lists to form a \u0093send\u0094. our customers\\nalso choose
        the level of access for the recipients assigned to the release by\\ndesignating
        whether the release can be streamed, downloaded, exported into an\\nunlocked
        digital format or burned to a cd. \\nwhile many clients are set up to manage
        and upload recipient\\nlists, most rely on the proprietary play mpe\u00ae
        network, which is quickly becoming\\na valuable asset to the industry. destiny
        staff manage lists of recipients in\\nvarious formats and those lists are
        available in the encoder to be selected. the\\nplay mpe\u00ae system provides
        play mpe\u00ae staff with the feedback and resources\\nnecessary to manage
        and maintain this network of recipients which is not\\navailable with physical
        distribution or smaller competitors. \\nstaff who \u0093encode\u0094 each
        release choose the access rights,\\nwhether the system should automatically
        generate a template driven marketing\\nemail alert, whether the song should
        be locked to the recipient computer and\\nwhich partner sites should have
        access to the content. \\n7\\n\\n\\non the impact date, the \u0093send\u0094
        appears in the \u0093available\\ntracks\u0094 section of the user\u0092s account.
        recipients can access through proprietary\\niphone, mac and windows based
        players, through a direct to web browser interface\\nsupporting playerless
        streaming and download or through partner sites, including\\nintegration into
        reporting systems such as mediabase, radio automation systems\\nsuch as nexgen
        or selector or through custom direct integration into the backend\\nserver
        systems at the radio chains. destiny''s proprietary applications offer\\npopular
        features, such as the ability to drag and drop to build and burn\\nplaylists
        to cd''s for music meetings, the ability to convert and export into a\\nwide
        variety of formats from the itunes aac format to the popular mp3 format and\\nto
        export metadata automatically into third party applications. \\nthe system
        generates an unbranded clipstream\u00ae format playerless\\nstreaming audio
        clip for previewing and two broadcast quality versions of the\\ndownloadable
        audio. the recipient can choose to receive a lossless compressed\\nexact copy
        of the original file at up to four times regular download speed or a\\nvariable
        bitrate compressed version, indistinguishable to the human ear, at up\\nto
        fifteen times regular download speed. recipients receive a custom library
        of\\navailable tracks and are able to repeat the download if music is lost.
        \\nall exported songs are marked in real time with destiny\u0092s\\npatent
        pending watermark technology. songs that appear on the internet are\\nscanned
        by the international federation of the phonographic industry\u0092s (\u0093ifpi\u0094)\\nfor
        our watermark. headquartered in london, uk, the ifpi is the organization\\nthat
        represents the interests of the recording industry worldwide and one of its\\nmissions
        is to safeguard the rights of record producers. ifpi web crawlers visit\\ntorrents,
        peer to peer networks and websites searching for unauthorized content.\\nwhen
        problem files are identified, the ifpi software looks for destiny\u0092s\\nwatermark
        in the content to identify the originating source. if a mark is found,\\ndestiny''s
        server and the originating label are automatically contacted so that\\nrecipient
        can be disabled from the system and appropriate action can be taken\\nagainst
        the individual to hold that recipient accountable for the unauthorized\\ndistribution.
        \\nafter the content is released, all activity by the recipient is\\nlogged
        in real time, providing record labels and promotions staff real time\\ndetail
        on which songs are accessed, streamed, downloaded and exported. this\\ncontrast
        directly with physical distribution where they are unsure whether the\\ncourier
        package went to the correct individual or whether it was opened. this\\ninformation
        provides invaluable feedback in real time to marketing and\\npromotions staff
        who can cater their programs appropriately. \\nfinally, details of the transaction
        are fed to the billing\\nservers for generation of automated monthly billing
        summaries for invoicing.\\n\\nreal time usage statistics for play mpe\u00ae
        are available at:\\nhttp://dsny.com/mpe%20stats \\nbusiness development \\nplay

        based\\nencoder which will permit a greater number of customers to utilize
        the play mpe\u00ae\\nsystem. when ready, this new encoder will permit customers
        to access our\\ndistribution tool through internet from a mac or pc, will

        on building out a\\nhost of features for the clipstream\u00ae cloud including
        content management,\\nsecurity, player customization, user-interface and billing
        components. we integrated the google cdn as a secondary  hosting provider
        to the amazon cdn.\\nongoing development through the year expanded the security\\noffering
        embedded in the clipstream\u00ae player, resulting in the enhanced security\\nplug-in,
        a browser-based application that enables content owners to block screen\\ncapture,
        copy-paste functions, screen-scraping and certain applications\\ncontained
        in a customizable blacklist. this component was a requirement of\\nexisting

        marketing of this offering began after\\nfiscal 2014 when clipstream\u00ae
        staff attended the casro (http://www.casro.org/)\\nannual conference, the
        major market research association convention. typical\\napplications include
        test marketing sensitive and pre-release television\\ncommercials, movie trailers,
        tv pilots, concepts and product demonstrations. the\\nplug-in is integrated
        in the cloud delivery and can be implemented by select\\nmarket research users
        in a self-service model. as well, work continued on\\nalready existing security
        features including dynamic watermarking and\\nhost-locking. customer review
        and feedback was positive and we should see early\\nevidence of completed
        evaluations and closed sales in the early weeks of\\ncalendar 2015. \\nongoing
        development advanced the reliability, functionality,\\ncross-platform functionality
        and performance of the underlying core clipstream\u00ae\\nvideo engine with
        expanded testing to all major mobile platforms as well as\\ncontinued compatibility
        work with the major pc and mac browsers. clipstream\\nvideo has been tested
        on all major pc, mac os, android, blackberry and ios\\nbrowsers and on dozens
        of the most popular mobile devices. major strides were\\nmade in the area
        of performance, image and audio quality for the player. \\n9\\n\\n\\nin february

        and development expenditures for the year ended\\naugust 31, 2014 were $1,062,668

        the largest market share of a relatively new\\nmarket and a network effect
        entrenches the system as it is difficult for any one\\nuser to switch to an
        alternative without the entire industry switching. the\\nnature of digital
        music distribution favors a monopoly service where there is\\none location
        where recipients can access content from labels around the world.\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\nplay
        mpe\u00ae has several advantages over physical distribution\\n(mail, courier
        or hand delivery) of manufactured cd\u0092s. digital distribution\\nthrough
        play mpe\u00ae is faster, less expensive, more reliable, more secure,\\nprovides
        additional real time and more accurate reporting of usage, provides a\\ngreat
        deal of added functionality and provides the error free and automatic\\ntransmission
        of \u0093metadata\u0094. metadata includes international standard recording\\ncodes
        (isrc) \u0096 which is a standard code for uniquely identifying sound\\nrecordings
        and music video recordings - song and artist names, beats per minute,\\nrelease
        and impact dates, etc. the automatic transmission of this metadata\\nreduces
        the time required for manual data entry into radio automation software\\non
        the receiving side and eliminates inaccuracies in royalty reporting. \\nthe
        play mpe\u00ae system provides our clients with a sophisticated\\ncontent
        management tool that includes privilege control, release sharing amongst\\nglobal
        territories (saving our clients time and money when conducting global\\ndistributions),
        enhanced email notification and promotions tools, social media\\nannouncements,
        recipient player apps (iphone, ipad, android, android tablet and\\nblackberry),
        with a fully redundant high speed infrastructure that is more\\nsophisticated
        and has higher functionality than quickly developed lower cost\\nalternatives.
        the company expects that competition will be strongest where audio\\nquality,
        security, recipient network, and reporting are not as important as\\ncost.

        \\nhistorically, the most common way to get streaming video was\\nthrough
        player based solutions, such as flash, windows media player and\\nquicktime.
        video would be typically hosted on one or more streaming servers,\\nwhich
        would be referred to indirectly by the web page on the web server. when\\nthe
        web page loaded, the streaming server that matched the browser and device
        of\\nthe viewer would be used to embed the video into the page. \\nthis had
        the notable disadvantage that users were required to\\nmaintain and update
        player plug-in software. this could be difficult for novice\\nusers and users
        that did not have administrative rights or situations where\\nupgrading the
        plug-in was not possible without also upgrading the operating\\nsystem. it
        was common for a significant portion of users were unable to see the\\nvideo.
        for applications such as advertising, those lower play rates meant lower\\nrevenues
        for the site owner running the ads. the most dominant format in the\\nlast
        few years has been flash from adobe, but adobe has discontinued support for\\nflash
        on devices. \\nweb pages are in the hypertext markup language format (html)\\nand
        the latest standard, supported by browsers released in the last few years,\\nis
        html 5. it supports a new <video> tag which enables browsers to\\nnatively
        play video without a player plug-in. the issue is that different\\nbrowsers
        support different formats. site owners have to encode video in multiple\\nformats
        to reach all computers and devices (\u0093transcoding\u0094). \\nas an example,
        video uploaded to consumer video sharing sites\\nwould be transcoded into
        h.264, web m and flash and three versions of the video\\nin these three separate
        formats would need to be stored. an html 5 compliant\\nbrowser would choose
        one of those formats to play back. \\nby contrast, clipstream\u00ae uses features
        only available in html 5\\ncompliant browsers, but not the <video> tag. this
        allows the video to play\\nwithout software on a wide range of platforms without
        a need for transcoding.\\n\\nflash and h.264 are the most widely supported
        formats, but\\nh.264 is being replaced by h.265. both h.264 and h.265 are
        protected by over one hundred patents and use of\\nthese formats requires
        payment of patent fees to the consortium\\n(http://www.mpegla.com). other
        formats, such as web m and ogg theora are\\nlikely to become more popular
        over time. \\n11\\n\\n\\nall of these formats are likely to be used extensively
        and\\ncompetitively, but they all have the disadvantage that they are not
        cross\\nplatform. we are not aware of another solution that does not require
        a streaming player plug-in, or that plays on all html 5 compliant\\nbrowsers
        on e-book readers, computers, smart phones, tablets and internet\\nenabled
        tv''s. \\nwe believe that, if granted, our seven patents will protect the\\ntechniques
        that we are using, so that no other competitor could offer a similar\\nsolution.
        \\nthe other major concern with html 5 video is that it does not\\nsupport
        digital rights management. the streaming formats that browsers would\\nnatively
        access are unencrypted formats and there is no easy way to stop users\\nfrom
        downloading the streaming files that the <video> tag points to. by\\ncontrast,
        clipstream\u00ae content can be locked to only play from authorized url''s\\nand
        it can be watermarked. because it can be hosted on the corporate web server\\nrather
        than third party content delivery networks, the authentication system and\\nthe
        streaming can lie on the same server. streams can be provided that will only\\nplay
        on the specified, authorized viewer computer that had just been previously\\nauthenticated.
        \\nclipstream\u00ae advantages \\n\\n\\n\u0095 \\n\\na clipstream\u00ae powered
        website does not require that its\\n      visitors download and install player
        software. clipstream\u00ae just plays.\\n      other solutions require intrusive
        codecs and new versions of their player\\n      in the background. \\n\\n\u00a0
        \\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\u0095 \\n\\nas clipstream\u00ae is playerless, management
        estimates that\\n      at least 10% more visitors see the rich media content.
        \\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\u0095 \\n\\nthe clipstream\u00ae solution is
        less intrusive and, as a\\n      result, safer for users. alternative solutions
        control a user\u0092s device and\\n      can be used by malicious sites to
        install malware. clipstream\u00ae content\\n      will never crash or compromise
        your machine. \\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\u0095 \\n\\nclipstream\u00ae content
        is uploaded to any brand of web\\n      server and just works. alternative

        server systems, running on dedicated\\n      hardware. \\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\u00a0
        \\n\\n\u0095 \\n\\nclipstream\u00ae plays on any javascript and html 5 enabled\\n      device,
        so playback is not restricted to computers. this cross platform\\n      approach
        means the same object will work for any browser on any brand of\\n      computer
        or device at any bitrate. (an autodetect procedure automatically\\n      delivers
        the highest possible stream quality). \\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\u0095
        \\n\\nbecause there is no player, clipstream\u00ae encoded media\\n      never
        becomes obsolete and never has to be re- encoded. other solutions\\n      launch
        new player software without backwards compatibility. \\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\u00a0
        \\n\\n\u0095 \\n\\nclipstream\u00ae media will automatically cache because
        it is\\n      an ordinary web component, just like a graphic or a block of
        text. this\\n      means that clipstream will save up to 90% on bandwidth
        cost (over 90% for\\n      ads), while providing much more reliable playback.
        this standards based\\n      approach means that there is no limit to simultaneous
        streams. \\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\u0095 \\n\\nclipstream\u00ae components
        can be uploaded to the cloud for\\n      third party hosting. player solutions
        require complicated server farms to\\n      handle more than a few thousand
        simultaneous visitors. \\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\u0095 \\n\\nclipstream\u00ae
        objects can be embedded into databases for\\n      long term storage and easy
        context sensitive retrieval. every aspect of\\n      the clipstream\u00ae
        engine can be accessed by web authoring tools to create a\\n      customized
        look and feel. \\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\u0095 \\n\\ndozens of parameters
        provide functionality not available\\n      from any other streaming solution.
        for example, clipstream\u00ae provides the\\n      only technology available
        to link every pixel or group of pixels in a\\n      banner to a different
        audio stream. this technology can be used for audio\\n      navigation of

        identified elsewhere in this annual report, including those risks\\nidentified
        under \u0093item 1. business\u0094, including competition and government\\nregulation,
        and \u0093item 7. management\u0092s discussion and analysis of financial condition
        and results of operations\u0094. if\\nany of these risks occur, our business
        and our operating results and financial\\ncondition could be seriously harmed.  \\n14\\n\\n\\nif
        revenues decline, then our financial condition and\\nresults of operations
        will be adversely affected. \\n97% of our revenue is generated from our play
        mpe\u00ae distribution\\nservice. competitors may arise and/or customers may
        not renew distribution\\ncontracts. this factor could cause our revenue to
        decrease with the result that\\nour financial condition and operating results
        would be adversely affected.\\ncompetitors have been small, regionally based,
        have limited resources, and have\\nyet to capture a material share of the
        market. if a competitor were to develop a\\ncomparable or superior product,
        our market share could be reduced. \\nif we are not able to control our operating
        expenses, then\\nour financial condition may be adversely affected. \\noperating
        expenses increased to $3,941,159 for the year ended\\naugust 31, 2014 from
        $3,443,150 for the year ended august 31, 2013 while our\\nrevenue decreased
        slightly to $3,572,376 for the year ended august 31, 2014 from\\n$3,679,029
        for the year ended august 31, 2013. our ability to achieve\\nprofitability
        is conditional upon our ability to control our operating expenses.\\nthere
        is a risk that we will have to increase our operating expenses in the\\nfuture.
        factors that could cause our operating expenses to increase include our\\ndetermination
        to spend more on sales and marketing in order to increase product\\nsales
        or our determination that more research and development expenditures are\\nrequired
        in order to keep our current software products competitive or in order\\nto
        develop new products for the market. to the extent that our operating\\nexpenses
        increase without a corresponding increase in revenue, our financial\\ncondition
        would be adversely impacted. \\nif we are not successful in legal proceedings
        against us,\\nthen our business and financial condition could be adversely
        affected. \\nwe are currently party to a claim against the company, as\\ndescribed
        in \u0093item 3. legal proceedings\u0094. if we are not successful in this
        legal\\nproceeding and are forced to make payments of damages to the plaintiffs,
        then\\nour business and our financial condition would be adversely affected.\\n\\nour
        success is dependent, to a large degree, upon the\\nefforts of mr. steve vestergaard,
        our current executive officer. \\nmr. vestergaard was the founder of destiny
        software and has\\nbeen involved in our business operations since our inception.
        the loss or\\nunavailability of mr. vestergaard could have an adverse effect
        on our business\\noperations and financial condition. we do not maintain key
        man life insurance\\npolicies for mr. vestergaard or for any of our other
        employees. in addition, our\\ncontinued success is dependent upon our ability
        to attract and retain qualified\\npersonnel in all areas of our business,
        especially management positions. in the\\nevent that we are unable to attract
        and retain qualified personnel, our business\\nwould be adversely affected.
        \\nour financial results may be adversely impacted by currency\\nfluctuations.
        \\nour revenues are primarily in united states dollars and euros\\nwhile our
        operating expenses are primarily in canadian dollars. an increase in\\nthe
        value of the canadian dollar in relation to the united states dollar and/or\\neuro
        could have the effect of increasing our loss from operations. we do not\\ncurrently
        hedge our foreign currency exposures. \\nif our products are defective or
        contain errors, we may\\nbecome subject to product liability claims. \\nas
        a result of their complexity, our software products may\\ncontain undetected
        errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions\\nare released.
        there can be no assurance that, despite testing we undertake and\\ntesting
        and use by current and potential customers, errors will not be found in\\nnew
        products after commencement of commercial shipments. the occurrence of such\\nerrors
        could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products,\\nwhich
        could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\\nand

        and patent applications that we believe are or may become essential to certain
        developing specifications in the 3gpp lte, sae project. we have agreed to
        make available a non-exclusive patent license under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
        terms and conditions, with compensation, or frand, to 3gpp members desiring
        to implement the technical specifications identified by us. we believe that
        we are positioned to license our essential security patents to 3gpp members
        as they move into deploying 4g/lte advanced devices and solutions.\\n\\n\\nwe
        have an ongoing gabriel licensing program under which we offer licenses to
        our patent portfolio, technology and software, including our secure domain
        name registry service, to domain infrastructure providers, communication service
        providers as well as to system integrators. our gabriel connection technology\u2122
        license is offered to oem customers who want to adopt the gabriel connection
        technology\u2122 as their solution for establishing secure connections using
        secure domain names within their products.\u00a0 we have developed gabriel
        connection technology\u2122 software development kit (sdk) to assist with
        rapid integration of these techniques into existing software implementations
        with minimal code changes and include object libraries, sample code, testing
        and quality assurance tools and the supporting documentation necessary for
        a customer to implement our technology. customers who want to develop their
        own implementation of the virnetx patented techniques for supporting secure
        domain names, or other techniques that are covered by our patent portfolio
        for establishing secure communication links, can purchase a patent license.
        the number of patents licensed, and therefore the cost of the patent license
        to the customer, will depend upon which of the patents are used in a particular
        product or service. these licenses will typically include an initial license
        fee, as well as an ongoing royalty.\\n\\n\\nin connection with the settlement
        of our lawsuit against microsoft corporation in 2010, microsoft became our
        first licensee.\u00a0 pursuant to the settlement and license agreement between

        employees include the core development team behind our patent portfolio, technology
        and software.\u00a0 this team has worked together for over ten years and is
        the same team that invented and developed this technology while working at
        leidos, inc.\u00a0(formerly known as saic) is a fortune 500\u00ae scientific,

        with leading 4g/lte companies (domain infrastructure providers, chipset manufacturers,
        service providers and others) and build our secure domain name registry.\\n\\n\\nindustry
        overview\\n\\n\\nwe believe that the rapid growth of mobile devices (smartphones/tablets/ultra-mobile
        pcs), with always-on network access, and need to socially interact with friends
        and family while maintaining a constant online presence has transformed the
        \u201cinternet of web 2.0\u201d in to the \u201cthe internet of the people\u201d.
        it has become, an evolving, rich and complex medium used by individuals and
        businesses to conduct commerce, share information and engage in real-time
        communications including email, text messaging, im, and voice and video calls.
        we believe the user demand for high speed broadband access along with the
        quality of experience wherever they are and whatever byod (bring your own
        device) they may be using; mobility, ip video delivery, and the move to cloud
        have dramatically changed the way service providers deliver services. while
        wireline networks remain the primary mechanism for delivering premium and
        high bandwidth services, its growth has held steady compared to the growth
        of the mobile communications. the cost barrier to obtaining a mobile device
        with data access has disappeared allowing billions of people to have online
        access on fixed and mobile networks, and those users accessing social networking
        websites, using peer-to-peer, or p2p applications, and uploading live content
        over the internet, which in turn is downloaded by millions, has led to staggering
        growth in packet traffic. not only is traffic growing and changing in nature,
        it\u2019s location of origin and timing has become completely unpredictable.
        there is a significant impact on the mobile signaling network, brought on
        by smartphone penetration and consumer use of \u201cchatty\u201d applications
        that do frequent network queries.\\n\\n\\nwe believe that as the users become
        more comfortable with using their smartphones/tablets and other connected
        devices, they will increasingly treat their mobile and fixed/wifi networks
        as a single network and demand seamless transition from one network type to
        another without any disruption of service. the 4g/lte standard was developed
        with the goal of creating a single ip network that is efficient, flexible,
        open up new business models and services revenues and eventually lead to true
        \u201cvirtual networks\u201d or software-defined networks (sdn). the service
        providers were forced to perform complete overhaul of their telecom network
        infrastructure in order to move from tdm paradigm to next generation ip networks
        based on 4g/lte for dealing with this rapidly growing demand. before these
        network overhauls could be completed, some service providers decided to mislabel
        their hybrid 3.5g/hspa+/partial lte implementations as 4g networks in order
        to stem the loss of revenue and protect themselves against the threat of being
        forever relegated to the role of pipe provider. this marketing ploy has led
        to significant confusion and misunderstanding among users.\\n\\n\\nadding
        further fuel to the demand for mobile and fixed broadband services is the
        fast adoption of connected machines or devices, or embedded systems capable
        of machine-to-machine (m2m) communication. these m2m communications are made
        possible by a device (non-phone/tablet/pc such as a sensor) that is attached
        to a machine to capture an event that is relayed over a network via 3g/4g
        routers or fixed broadband lines, delivering data or events (such as temperature,
        location, consumption, heart rate, stress levels, light, movement, altitude
        and speed) to applications creating an \u201cinternet of things\u201d or iot.
        as the service providers start deploying true 4g (long term evolution-advanced,
        or lte-advanced) and this pace picks up, we believe that almost every device
        will get its own unique identity and a high-speed connection to the internet
        over a high speed ip (internet protocol) based telecommunication network making
        it an \u201cinternet of everything\u201d.\\n\\n\\nwe believe that growing
        security concerns and vulnerabilities in a large number of use-case scenarios
        due to the inherent \u201copen\u201d nature of this architecture can throttle
        the successful adoption of these technologies. security can no longer exist
        as a point solution, and enterprises everywhere are currently upgrading core
        it infrastructure (systems, networks, and management) to integrate security
        into everything. because of the complexity of today\u2019s networks and the
        requirement to connect users from any location at any time on any device,
        enterprise buyers looking to improve security posture have to evaluate everything
        from software solutions for smartphones to routers and switches with integrated
        security, massive security appliances for data centers, cloud-based security
        services, and security solutions for virtualized environments and public and
        private clouds.\\n\u00a0\\nthe portions of the ip-telephony, mobility, fixed-mobile
        convergence and unified communications markets that could benefit from our
        software and technology solutions, as forecasted by infonetics and by our
        internal estimates, are expected to grow from approximately $96 billion of
        worldwide revenues in 2012 to approximately $342 billion by 2017, representing
        a compound annual growth rate, or cagr, of approximately 29%. we believe that
        this growing trend represents a significant opportunity for us to license
        our technology and software, and establish our secure domain name registry.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\nindex\\n\\n\\nenterprise
        telephony \u2013 unified communications, voip, telepresence and video conferencing\\n\\n\\nenterprise\u00a0telephony
        includes technologies that use internet protocol\u2019s packet-switched connections
        to exchange voice, fax, and other forms of information traditionally carried
        over the dedicated circuit-switched connections of the public switched telephone
        network, or pstn.\u00a0 the adoption of enterprise telephony has helped businesses
        significantly lower network operating costs by using a common network for
        voice and data. as the workforce becomes increasingly dispersed, mobile features
        enabled by internet protocol-based communications such as presence, unified
        messaging, peer-to-peer applications, find me/follow me, white-boarding and
        document sharing have become more commonplace.\u00a0 however, the development
        of the related security infrastructure has lagged behind, leaving next-generation
        networks vulnerable to a multitude of threats including man-in-middle, eavesdropping,
        domain hijacking, distributed denial of service, or ddos, spam over internet
        telephony, or spit, and spam over instant messaging, or spim.\u00a0 these
        threats continue to highlight the need for securing next-generation networks.\u00a0
        as the use of enterprise telephony systems extends beyond the boundaries of
        an organization\u2019s private network, security is likely to become an even
        bigger concern. enterprises are increasingly deploying an array of communication
        methodologies integrated into a single communications experience is often
        referred to as unified communications. we believe that unified communications
        have higher utility and can increase productivity for users. the basic components
        of unified communications include: a directory for storing addresses, various
        modes of communication with each user/contact (desk phone, mobile phone, im,
        etc.), message storage for all messages regardless of communication method
        and secure presence of a user''s status for each mode of communication (available,
        away, busy, etc.).\\n\\n\\nbased on our estimates using infonetics and other
        market data, we believe that worldwide revenue from ip telephony products
        like ip-pbx including ip phones, service provider voip and ims equipment,
        voip gateways, enterprise telepresence and video conferencing for businesses
        and unified communication clients, is expected to grow from approximately
        $38 billion in 2012 to approximately $60 billion in 2017, representing a cagr
        of approximately 9%.\u00a0 we believe our unique and patented solution provides
        the robust security platform required for providing on-demand secure communication
        links between enterprises intending to communicate securely without manually
        configuring the connections.\u00a0 we believe a standard security solution
        such as ours will further accelerate the adoption of enterprise telephony
        products in the market and allow enterprises to take full advantage of these
        rich content applications and real-time communications over the internet,
        thereby significantly increasing their return on investment.\\n\\n\u00a0\\nip
        mobility- smartphones, embedded devices, machine-to-machine (m2m) devices
        (lte)\\n\\n\\nwe believe that telecommunication markets are rapidly changing
        and presenting new challenges to the equipment and service providers, including
        but not limited to increasing user demand for mobile, always-on connections
        with multiple devices. we also believe that traffic growth, video acceleration,
        cloud services and a rapidly growing number of subscribers challenge currently
        available network architectures and that, because of this, service providers
        and carriers will eventually use a single network for fixed and mobile communications,
        private/premium communications and internet access, in spite of the difficulties
        involved challenging their business models and forcing the consideration of
        new network architectures. we believe that lte technology will deliver users
        the benefits of faster data speeds and new services by creating a new radio
        access technology that''s optimized for ip-based traffic and offers operators
        a simple upgrade path from 3g networks.\\n\\n\\nsmartphones are multi-functional
        devices that handle a wide variety of business-critical applications and support
        increasingly complex functions including enhanced data processing, internet
        access, e-mail access, calendars and scheduling, contact management and the
        ability to view electronic documents. users have continual access to these
        applications while on the move making them an increasingly essential business
        tool for the mobile worker. these devices enable mobile workers to have similar
        functionality inside or outside the office thereby increasing employee efficiency.
        however, it is critical that this mobile environment have the same level of
        security as an enterprise''s internal network.\\n\\n\\nembedded mobile broadband
        computing devices include pcs, netbooks, tablets, and mobile internet devices

        (m2m), connected devices, or embedded systems, connected machines are fast
        becoming the eyes and ears of the enterprise. by adding sensors and networking
        technologies to the products they sell and the equipment they employ, companies
        are finding new ways to gather powerful insights and use new forms of data,
        thus creating a vast \u201cinternet of things\u201d. this communication\u00a0is
        made possible by a device (such as an intelligent sensor) that is attached
        to a machine to capture an event, such as such as temperature, location, consumption,
        heart rate, stress levels, light, movement, altitude and speed, that is relayed
        over a network delivering data to applications. the potential application
        for this technology is limitless. there are smart meters in energy and utilities
        (the \u201csmart grid\u201d), connected vehicles in automotive and logistics,
        heart monitors in healthcare, rfid tagged inventory in retail and manufacturing,
        and digital signage in media and communications to name a few. another fast
        growing application is in the wearable technology products namely, fitness
        and wellness, infotainment, healthcare and medical, and industrial and military.
        the fitness and wellness segment comprises products like smart clothing and
        smart sensors, activity monitors, sleep sensors and others, whereas the infotainment
        sector consists of products like smart watches, heads-up displays, smart glasses
        and others. the products like continuous glucose monitor, drug delivery, monitors,
        wearable patches and others have been covered under healthcare and medical
        segment and products like hand worn terminals, augmented reality headsets
        and others have been mentioned under industrial and military segment. we believe
        that the large revenue potential for m2m services that has attracted the attention
        of carriers globally risks being thwarted by the growing security concerns
        in m2m applications. porous security is exposing vulnerabilities in a large
        number of use-case scenarios, including cars, energy management systems, telemedicine,
        and telemetry. while built-in security is a high priority in all other information
        and communication technologies, it is yet to be considered, even at a basic
        level, in most m2m applications. the rapid and successful adoption of m2m
        in automobiles, healthcare, industrial installations, and consumer homes may
        be jeopardized if communication security is not designed in to all m2m devices
        and applications. all these new devices will require a unique identity addressable
        by a secure domain name and all their communications, with application servers
        and other devices, completely secured automatically and on-demand.\\n\\n\\nip
        mobility services require\u00a0 an environment where wired and wireless phones
        work together with internet protocol to deliver services (voice, video, data
        and combinations thereof) uniformly across multiple access networks, including,
        among others, lte, wimax, wifi cellular and fixed. based on our estimates
        using infonetics and other market data, we believe that worldwide revenue
        from ip mobility products like smartphones, embedded devices, hotspots and
        mobile data cards, femtocell equipment, m2m communication devices and services
        is expected to grow from approximately $57 billion in 2012 to approximately
        $282 billion by 2017, representing a cagr of approximately 37%. we believe
        in order to realize the full functionality of ip mobility, several challenges
        including security must be overcome. when users are mobile, connections and
        data need to cross multiple network boundaries, each of which poses a security
        threat. wireless networks may be threatened or compromised by rogue users
        who enter through (insecure wireless access points. we believe that providing
        authenticated access to the m2m networks and enterprise applications are important
        requirements and represent a significant market opportunity for our patented
        technology and secure domain names to provide users or machines fully authenticated
        secure access on a \"zero-click\" or \"single-click\" basis.\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\nindex\\n\\n\\nour

        with new customers.\\n\\n\\ncompetition\\n\\n\\nwe believe our technology
        and solutions will compete primarily against various proprietary security
        solutions.\u00a0 we group these solutions into three main categories:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u25cf\\nproprietary
        or home-grown application specific security solutions have been developed
        by vendors and integrated directly into their products for our target markets
        including ip-telephony, mobility, fixed-mobile convergence, and unified communications.\u00a0
        these proprietary solutions have been developed due to the lack of standardized
        approaches to securing real-time communications.\u00a0 this approach has led
        to corporate networks that are isolated and, as a result, restrict enterprises
        to using these next-generation networks within the boundaries of their private
        network.\u00a0 these solutions generally do not provide security for communications
        over the internet or require network administrators to manually exchange keys
        and other security parameters with each destination network outside their
        corporate network boundary.\u00a0 the cost-savings and other benefits of ip-based
        real-time communications are significantly limited by this approach to securing
        real-time communications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u25cf\\na session
        border controller, or sbc, is a device used in networks to exert control over
        the signaling and media streams involved in establishing, conducting and terminating
        voip calls.\u00a0 a traditional firewall or network address translation, or
        nat, device typically block information like endpoint ip addresses and port
        numbers required by signaling protocols, such as sip and xmpp, to reach and
        communicate with their intended destination.\u00a0 sbcs are used in physical
        networks to address these limitations and enable real-time session traffic
        to cross the boundaries created by firewalls and other nat devices and enable
        voip calls to be established successfully.\u00a0 however, sbcs must decrypt
        and analyze every single data packet for the information to be transmitted
        successfully, thereby preventing end-to-end encryption.\u00a0 this network
        design results in sbcs becoming a single point of congestion on the network,
        as well as a single point of failure.\u00a0 sbcs are also limited to the physical
        network they secure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u25cf\\nsip firewalls,
        or sip-aware firewalls, and application layer gateways, manage and protect
        the traffic, flow and quality of voip and other sip-related communications.\u00a0
        they perform real-time network address translation, dynamic firewall functions;
        support multiple signaling protocols, and media functionality, allowing secure
        interconnection and the flow of ip media streams across multiple networks.\u00a0
        while sip firewalls assist in analyzing sip traffic transmitted over the corporate
        network to filter out various threats, they do not necessarily encrypt the
        traffic.\u00a0 as a result, this traffic is not entirely secure from end-to-end
        nor is it protected against threats like man-in-middle and eavesdropping.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nintellectual

        laws governing online secure communications remain largely unsettled, even
        in areas where there has been legislative action.\u00a0 it may take years
        to determine whether and how existing laws governing intellectual property,
        privacy and libel apply to online communications and media.\u00a0 such legislation
        may interfere with the growth in use of online secure communications and decrease
        the acceptance of online secure communications as a viable solution, which
        could adversely affect our business.\\n\\n\\ndue to the internet\u2019s popularity
        and increasing use, new laws regulating secure communications may be adopted.
        these laws and regulations may cover, among other things, issues relating
        to privacy, pricing, taxation, telecommunications over the internet, content,
        copyrights, distribution and quality of products and services. we intend to

        u.s. government has controlled the authoritative domain name system, or dns,
        root server since the inception of the internet.\u00a0 on july 1, 1997, the
        president of the united states directed the u.s. secretary of commerce to
        privatize the management of the domain name system in a manner that increases
        competition and facilitates international participation in its management.\\n\\n\\non
        september 29, 2006, the u.s. department of commerce extended its delegation
        of authority by entering into a new agreement with the internet corporation
        for assigned names and numbers, or icann, a california non-profit corporation
        headquartered in marina del rey, california.\u00a0 icann is responsible for
        managing the accreditation of registry providers and registrars that manage
        the assignment of top level domain names associated with the authoritative
        dns root directory.\u00a0 although it is possible to create and manage other
        dns root directories privately without accreditation from icann, the possibility
        of conflicting name and number assignments makes it less likely that users
        would widely adopt a top level domain name associated with an alternative
        dns root directory provided by a non-icann-accredited registry service.\\n\\n\\nwe
        are aware of the recent announcements made by icann related to the anticipated
        launch of new domain name extensions and an icann-supervised trademark clearinghouse
        to assist brand owners with protecting their trademarks during the initial
        launch of the new domain name extensions. we are currently evaluating whether
        we will apply to become an icann-accredited registry provider with respect
        to one or more customized generic top-level domain (gtld), or create our own
        alternative dns root directory to manage the assignment of non-standard secure
        domain names.\u00a0 we have not yet begun discussions with icann and we cannot
        assure you that we will be successful in obtaining icann accreditation for
        our registry service on terms acceptable to us or at all.\u00a0 whether or
        not we obtain accreditation from icann, we will be subject to the ongoing
        risks arising out of the delegation of the u.s. government\u2019s responsibilities
        for the domain name system to the u.s. department of commerce and icann and

        the following information and the other information in this form 10-k in evaluating
        our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect
        to our common stock. if any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial
        condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely
        affected. in such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline,
        and you could lose all or part of your investment. the risks and uncertainties
        we describe below are not the only ones facing us. additional risks not presently
        known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.\\n\\n\\nwe
        may not be able to capitalize on market opportunities related to our licensing
        strategy or our patent portfolio.\\n\\n\\nour business strategy includes licensing
        our patents and technology to other companies in order to reach a larger end-user
        base than we could reach through direct sales and marketing efforts; as such
        our business strategy and revenues will depend on intellectual property licensing
        fees and royalties for the majority of our revenues.\u00a0 we currently derive
        nominal revenue from licensing activities and we cannot assure you that we
        will successfully capitalize on our market opportunities or that our current
        business strategy will succeed.\u00a0 factors that may affect our ability
        to execute our current business strategy including, but are not limited to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\nalthough
        we have to date entered into a limited number of settlement and license agreements,
        we may not be successful in entering into further licensing relationships
        and existing settlement and license agreements may not generate the financial
        results we expect;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\nthird parties may
        challenge the validity of our patents;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\nthe
        pendency of our various litigations may cause potential licensees not to do
        business with us;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\nwe expect that we
        will face intense competition new and established competitors who may have
        superior products and services or better marketing, financial or other capacities
        than we do; and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\nit is possible that
        one or more of our potential customers or licensees develops or otherwise
        sources products or technologies similar to, competitive with or superior
        to ours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nif we are not able to adequately protect our patent
        rights, our business would be negatively impacted.\\n\\n\\nwe believe our
        patents are valid, enforceable and valuable.\u00a0 notwithstanding this belief,
        third parties may make claims of non-infringement or invalidity claims with
        respect to our patents and such claims could give rise to material cost for
        defense or settlement or both, jeopardize or substantially delay a successful
        outcome of litigation we are or may become involved in, divert resources away
        from our other activities, or otherwise materially and adversely affect our
        business.\u00a0 similar challenges could also prevent us from obtaining additional
        patents in the future.\u00a0 even if we are successful in enforcing our rights,
        our patents may not ultimately provide us with any competitive advantages
        and may be less valuable than we currently expect.\u00a0 these risks may be
        heightened in countries other than the united states, and may be negatively
        affected by the fact that legal standards in the united states and elsewhere
        for protection of intellectual property rights in internet-related businesses
        are uncertain and still evolving.\u00a0 in addition, there are a significant
        number of united states and foreign patents and patent applications in our
        areas of interest, and we expect that significant litigation in these areas
        will continue, and will add uncertainty to the value of certain patents and
        other intellectual property rights in our areas of interest.\u00a0 if we are
        unable to protect our intellectual property rights or otherwise realize value
        from them, our business would be negatively affected.\\n\\n\\nour litigation
        can be time-consuming, costly and we cannot anticipate the results.\\n\\n\\nwe
        spend a significant amount of our financial and management resources to pursue
        our current litigation matters.\u00a0 we believe that these litigation matters
        and others that we may in the future determine to pursue could continue for
        years and continue to consume significant financial and management resources.\u00a0
        the counterparties to our litigation are all large, well-financed companies
        with substantially greater resources than us.\u00a0 we cannot assure you that
        any of our current or future litigation matters will result in a favorable
        outcome for us.\u00a0 in addition, even if we obtain favorable interim rulings
        or verdicts in particular litigation matters, they may not be predictive of
        the ultimate resolution of the dispute.\u00a0 also, we cannot assure you that
        we will not be exposed to claims or sanctions against us which may be costly
        or impossible for us to defend.\u00a0 unfavorable or adverse outcomes may
        result in losses, exhaustion of financial resources or other adverse effects
        which could encumber our ability to develop and commercialize products.\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\nindex\\n\\n\\nwe
        can provide no assurances that the licensing of our essential security patents
        under frand will be successful.\\n\\n\\nat the request of the european telecommunications
        standards institute (etsi), and the alliance for telecommunications industry
        solutions (atis), we agreed to update our licensing declaration to etsi and
        atis under their respective intellectual property rights (ipr) policies.\u00a0
        this was in response to our statement of patent holder identifying a group
        of our patents and patent applications that we believe are or may become essential
        to certain developing specifications in the 3rd generation partnership project
        (3gpp) long term evolution (lte), systems architecture evolution (sae) project.\u00a0
        we will make available a non-exclusive patent license under frand (fair, reasonable
        and non-discriminatory terms and conditions, with compensation) for the patents
        identified by virnetx that are or become essential, to applicants desiring
        to implement the technical specifications identified by virnetx, as set forth
        in the updated licensing declaration under the atis and etsi ipr policies.
        while we believe that our frand commitment positions us to license our essential
        security patents for the technical specifications identified by virnetx, our
        licensing declarations under the atis and etsi ipr policies may limit our
        flexibility in determining royalties and license terms for certain of our
        patents.\u00a0 consequently, we cannot assure you that the licensing of the
        essential security patents will be successful or that third parties will be
        willing to enter into licenses with virnetx on reasonable terms or at all,
        which could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our competitive
        position.\\n\\n\\nbecause our business is conducted or expected to be conducted
        in an environment that is subject to rapid change, we may be subjected to
        various developments in regulation, law and consumer preferences to which
        we may not be able to adapt successfully.\\n\\n\\nthe current regulatory environment
        for our products and services remains unclear.\u00a0 we can give no assurance
        that our planned product offerings will be in compliance with laws and regulations
        of local, state, united states federal or foreign authorities.\u00a0 further,
        we can give no assurance that we will not unintentionally violate such laws
        or regulations or that such laws or regulations will not be modified, or that
        new laws or regulations will be enacted in the future which would cause us
        to be in violation of such laws or regulations.\u00a0 for example, voice-over-internet
        protocol (or voip) services are not currently subject to all of the same regulations
        that apply to traditional telephony, but it is possible that similar regulations
        may be applied to voip in the future and that these could result in substantial
        costs and adversely affect the marketability of our products and planned products
        related to voip.\u00a0 for further example, the use of the internet and private
        internet protocol (ip) networks for communication is largely unregulated within
        the united states, but may become regulated in the future; also several foreign
        governments have enacted measures that could restrict or prohibit voice communications
        services over the internet or private ip networks.\\n\u00a0\\nour business
        depends on the growth of instant messaging, voip, mobile services, streaming
        video, file transfer and remote desktop and other next-generation internet-based
        applications which are relatively new.\u00a0 a decline in the use of these
        applications due to complexity or cost of these applications relative to alternate
        traditional or newly developed communications channels, or development of
        alternative technologies, could cause a material decline in the number of
        users in these areas.\\n\\n\\nmore aggressive domestic or international regulation
        of the internet in general, and internet telephony providers and services
        specifically, or a lack of growth in acceptance of the internet as a long
        term viable marketplace for communications services, may materially and adversely
        affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects.\\n\\n\\nour
        exposure to outside influences beyond our control, including new legislation,
        court rulings or actions by the united states patent and trademark office,
        could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement activities and results
        of operations.\\n\\n\\nour licensing and enforcement activities are subject
        to numerous risks from outside influences, including the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u2022\\nnew
        legislation, regulations, court and agency\u00a0decisions,\u00a0or rules related
        to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our
        operating costs and decrease our revenue. for instance, the u.s. supreme court
        has recently modified some tests used by the united states patent and trademark
        office (uspto) in granting patents during the past 20 years which may decrease
        the likelihood that we will be able to obtain patents and increase the likelihood
        of challenge of any patents we obtain or license.\u00a0 in addition, the u.s.
        recently enacted sweeping changes to the united states patent system under
        the leahy-smith america invents act (\u201caia\u201d), including changes that
        transition the united states from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to
        a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system and alter the processes for challenging
        issued patents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u2022\\nmore patent applications
        are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by
        the uspto.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u2022\\nfederal courts are becoming
        more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nif
        we experience security breaches, we could be exposed to liability and our
        reputation and business could suffer.\\n\\n\\nwe expect to retain certain
        confidential customer information in our secure data centers and secure domain
        name registry.\u00a0 it will be critical to our business strategy that our
        facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace
        to be secure.\u00a0 our secure domain name registry operations will also depend
        on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in
        effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption,
        and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration
        system.\u00a0 the secure domain name servers that we will operate will be
        critical hardware to our registry services operations.\u00a0 therefore, we
        expect to have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase
        the security of our facilities and infrastructure.\u00a0 security technologies
        are constantly being tested by computer professionals, academics and \u201chackers.\u201d
        advances in the techniques for attacking security solutions could make some
        or all of our products obsolete or unmarketable.\u00a0 likewise, if any of
        our products are found to have significant security vulnerabilities, then
        we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminate the vulnerabilities
        and to repair or replace products already sold or licensed to our customers.\u00a0
        despite our security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical
        break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems.\u00a0
        it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources
        to address such problems.\u00a0 any physical or electronic break-in or other
        security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data
        centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of
        information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks
        of our customers.\u00a0 in such an event, we could face significant liability
        and customers could be reluctant to use our services.\u00a0 such an occurrence
        could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the
        market\u2019s perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications
        over ip networks as well as the security or reliability of our services.\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\nindex\\n\\n\\na
        security breach could require a substantial amount of expense to rectify and
        could result in a product liability claim that causes us to incur substantial
        liability and related legal and other costs.\u00a0 a security breach may also
        harm our reputation and make it more difficult or impossible for us to successfully
        market to others.\u00a0 these matters could harm our operating results and
        financial condition.\\n\\n\\nwe expect that we will experience long and unpredictable
        sales cycles, which may impact our operating results.\\n\\n\\nwe expect that

        we will be substantially dependent on a concentrated number of customers.\u00a0
        if we are unable to establish, maintain or replace our relationships with

        and 2012 and 2013 revenues were derived from settlement and license agreements

        infringements. there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional
        customers, or if we do so, to sustain our revenue levels from these prospective
        customers.\u00a0 if we are not able to establish, maintain or replace the
        limited group of prospective customers that we anticipate may generate a substantial
        majority of our revenues in the future, or if they do not generate revenues

        consolidated financial statements were restated in 2011 in connection with
        our identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial
        reporting; we may identify future material weakness which may result in late
        filings, increased costs or declines in our share price.\\n\\n\\nin early
        2011, we restated our previously filed financial statements for the fiscal
        quarter ended september 30, 2010, each of the then previous five fiscal quarters
        and the fiscal year ended december 31, 2009, to adjust our accounting for
        our series i warrants.\u00a0 in connection with these restatements, we determined
        that we had not maintained effective control over our accounting for these
        series i warrants and, as a result, that a material weakness existed with
        respect to our reporting of complex, non-routine transactions as of the end
        of the periods covered by the form 10-k and form 10-qs that included the financial
        statements referenced above. although we believe that we currently maintain
        effective control over our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
        control over financial reporting as regards this issue, we may in the future
        identify deficiencies regarding the design and effectiveness of our system
        of internal control over financial reporting.\u00a0\u00a0 if we experience
        any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting the
        future or are unable to provide unqualified management or attestation reports
        about our internal controls, we may be unable to meet financial and other
        reporting deadlines and may incur costs associated with remediation, and any
        of which could cause our share price to decline.\\n\\n\\nwe do not currently
        pay dividends on our common stock and thus stockholders must look to appreciation
        of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments.\\n\\n\\nalthough
        we paid a special cash dividend to holders of our common stock in 2010, we
        do not currently pay regular dividends on our common stock and instead intend
        to retain our cash and future earnings, if any\u00a0to fund our business plan.\u00a0
        our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors
        and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition,
        results of operations, capital requirements, and investment opportunities.\u00a0
        we therefore can\u2019t assure you that our board of directors will determine
        to pay regular or special dividends in the future. accordingly, unless our
        board of directors determines to pay dividends, stockholders will be required
        to look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment.\u00a0
        this appreciation may not occur.\\n\\n\\nthe exercise of our outstanding stock
        options would result in a dilution of our current stockholders'' voting power
        and an increase in the number of shares eligible for future resale in the
        public market which may negatively impact the market price of our stock.\\n\\n\\nthe
        exercise of our outstanding vested stock options would dilute the ownership
        interests of our existing stockholders. as of december 31, 2013, we had outstanding
        options and restricted stock units to purchase an aggregate of 5,225,764 shares
        of common stock (representing 10.19% of our total shares outstanding as of
        december 31, 2013) of which 4,410,411 are vested and therefore exercisable.
        to the extent outstanding stock options are exercised, additional shares of
        common stock will be issued, and such issuance would dilute non-exercising
        stockholders'' percentage voting interests and increase the number of shares
        eligible for resale in the public market.\\n\\n\\nthe fair value of accounting
        for our series i warrants as derivative liabilities may materially impact

        and hedging \u2013 contracts in entity\u2019s own equity.\u201d\u00a0 these
        derivative liabilities are reported at fair value each reporting period with
        changes in the fair value recognized as gain or loss during each reporting
        period.\u00a0 an increase in our share price or measure of our share price
        volatility, for example, will generally result in an increase in the fair
        value of our warrant liability and a non-cash charge during the period of
        such increase, which could materially and negatively impact our results of
        operations in future periods.\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\nindex\\n\\n\\ntrading in our

        in the past due to several factors. we expect that our future operating results
        may also fluctuate due to the same or similar factors.\u00a0 we had a net
        loss of $17.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2011, a net loss $26.9
        million for the year ended december 31, 2012 and a net loss of $27.6 million\u00a0for
        the year ended december 31, 2013 with an accumulated deficit of $90.5 million.

        may make our business particularly difficult to manage, adversely affect our
        business and operating results, make our operating results difficult for investors
        to predict and, further, cause our results to fall below investor\u2019s expectations
        and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\\n\\n\\nbecause
        ownership of our common stock is concentrated, investors may have limited
        influence on stockholder decisions.\\n\\n\\nas of december 31, 2013, our executive
        officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 20% of our then outstanding
        common stock.\u00a0 in addition, a group of stockholders that, as of december
        31, 2007, held 4,766,666 shares, or approximately 12%, of our then outstanding
        common stock, have entered into a voting agreement with us that requires them
        to vote all of their shares of our voting stock in favor of the director nominees
        approved by our board of directors at each director election going forward,
        and in a manner that is proportional to the votes cast by all other voting
        shares as to any other matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote.\u00a0
        however, we cannot be certain how many shares of our common stock this group
        of stockholders currently owns.\u00a0 because of their beneficial ownership
        interest, our officers and directors could significantly influence stockholder
        actions of which you disapprove or that are contrary to your interests.\u00a0
        this ability to exercise significant influence could prevent or significantly
        delay another company from acquiring or merging with us.\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\nindex\\n\\n\\nour
        protective provisions could make it difficult for a third party to successfully
        acquire us even if you would like to sell your stock to them.\\n\\n\\nwe have
        a number of protective provisions that could delay, discourage or prevent
        a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board
        of directors.\u00a0 our protective provisions include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u25cf\\na
        staggered board of directors: this means that only one or two directors (since
        we have a five-person board of directors) will be up for election at any given
        annual meeting.\u00a0 this has the effect of delaying the ability of stockholders
        to effect a change in control of us because it would take two annual meetings
        to effectively replace a majority of the board of directors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u25cf\\nblank
        check preferred stock: our board of directors has the authority to establish
        the rights, preferences and privileges of our 10,000,000 authorized, but unissued,
        shares of preferred stock.\u00a0 therefore, this stock may be issued at the
        discretion of our board of directors with preferences over your shares of
        our common stock in a manner that is materially dilutive to you.\u00a0 in
        addition, blank check preferred stock can be used to create a \u201cpoison
        pill\u201d which is designed to deter a hostile bidder from buying a controlling
        interest in our stock without the approval of our board of directors.\u00a0
        we have not adopted such a \u201cpoison pill;\u201d but our board of directors
        has the ability to do so in the future, very rapidly and without stockholder
        approval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u25cf\\nadvance notice requirements
        for director nominations and for new business to be brought up at stockholder
        meetings: stockholders wishing to submit director nominations or raise matters
        to a vote of the stockholders must provide notice to us within very specific
        date windows and in very specific form in order to have the matter voted on
        at a stockholder meeting.\u00a0 this has the effect of giving our board of
        directors and management more time to react to stockholder proposals generally
        and could also have the effect of disregarding a stockholder proposal or deferring
        it to a subsequent meeting to the extent such proposal is not raised properly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u25cf\\nno
        stockholder actions by written consent: no stockholder or group of stockholders
        may take actions rapidly and without prior notice to our board of directors
        and management or to the minority stockholders.\u00a0 along with the advance
        notice requirements described above, this provision also gives our board of
        directors and management more time to react to proposed stockholder actions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u25cf\\nsuper
        majority requirement for stockholder amendments to the by-laws: stockholder
        proposals to alter or amend our by-laws or to adopt new by-laws can only be
        approved by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares
        of our common stock.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u25cf\\nno ability of stockholders
        to call a special meeting of the stockholders: only the board of directors
        or management can call special meetings of the stockholders.\u00a0 this could
        mean that stockholders, even those who represent a significant percentage
        of our shares of common stock, may need to wait for the annual meeting before
        nominating directors or raising other business proposals to be voted on by
        the stockholders.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\nindex\\n\\n\\nin addition,

        groups involved with the broadcast and post-production segments of the industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0
        \\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe also promote our products
        through email campaigns, webinars, advertisements placed in relevant journals
        and online sites, our website, chyronhego storytellers, our customer testimonial
        video series, industry associations, such as the sports video group, knowledge
        base and forum, and social media marketing venues such as facebook\u00ae,
        twitter\u00ae, linkedin, google+\u00ae, and youtube\u00ae.\u00a0in addition,
        our engineering and corporate staff publish articles, present papers, and
        are quoted in trade journals and papers presented at technical conventions,
        which we believe reinforces and promotes our industry credentials.\\n\\n\\nour
        aim is to continue to expand the range and sophistication of our marketing
        tools. we offer marketing and instructional podcasts on our website, and we
        continually refresh our library of tutorials, white papers, workflow diagrams
        and system diagrams. periodically, we send an electronic marketing package
        highlighting a product or product line to clients and potential clients. a
        critical component of our sales strategy is the development of effective product
        and workflow demonstrations. we believe that the ability to conduct successful
        demonstrations is important in proving the reliability and innovation of our
        products, and results in the retention of existing customers and the acquisition
        of new business. we also perform online video demonstrations which have become
        a valuable and cost-saving marketing tool for us. additionally, we aim to
        expand the chyronhego brand throughout the globe and to increase our international
        footprint and position.\\n\\n\\nsales of our broadcast products worldwide
        are made through our direct sales personnel as well as through third-party
        dealers, independent representatives and systems integrators. direct sales,
        marketing and product specialists serving our global markets act as links
        between the customer and our development team.\\n\\n\\nservice and support\\n\\n\\nwe
        offer technical service and support to our customers via 24-hours-per-day,
        seven-days-per-week, 52-weeks-per-year access to highly trained service and
        support professionals. we employ online video conferencing to help customers
        resolve problems and update software on their systems, speeding resolution
        and cutting costs. we have instituted an on-line case submission system, which
        enables our customers to submit a case to the support team and provides them
        with a \"help desk at their fingertips\" via the web. we provide a searchable
        knowledge base which is continually updated with current information. service
        is provided both domestically and internationally by chyronhego or through
        our appointed dealers and representatives.\\n\\n\\nproper training is essential
        for the success of our customers. we offer a comprehensive course catalog,
        with scalable and fixed-duration training courses tailored to varying levels
        of proficiency and generally consisting of a mix of classroom discussions
        and hands-on training. training courses are held at our melville, ny headquarters
        or on site at the customer''s facility, as required. we make training available
        to a wider user base by offering online video conferencing courses in which
        users can participate in interactive instruction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0

        customers with hardware, software and performance maintenance contracts and
        spare parts. we believe that support contracts and an easily available spare
        parts supply facilitate customer satisfaction. we generally provide one-year
        warranties on all of our products. there may be, in certain instances, exceptions
        to these terms. a provision is made in our consolidated financial statements
        to estimate the warranty cost in products sold based on historical actual
        results.\\n\\n\\nmanufacturing\\n\\n\\nour final assembly, system integration
        and test operations are located at our headquarters in melville, ny. we use
        third-party vendors to manufacture and supply many of our hardware components
        and sub-assemblies. we rely on a limited number of suppliers for major hardware
        components.\u00a0we continually review product specifications in order to
        diversify the sourcing of critical components. with our current architecture,
        we use many \"off-the-shelf\" components. this not only permits us greater
        flexibility in sourcing of components, but also provides higher gross margins
        on our products due to lower costs achieved through competitive sourcing and
        greater commonality of components among our products.\\n\\n\\ncustomers\\n\\n\\nthere
        were no customers that individually represented in excess of 10% of our consolidated
        revenues for 2013 or 2012.\\n\\n\\ncompetition\\n\\n\\nthe markets for our
        products are highly competitive and are characterized by rapid technological
        change and evolving industry standards. product obsolescence, frequent development
        of new products, new technologies and significant price erosion are all features
        of the industry in which we operate.\\n\\n\\nthe explosion of alternative
        media outlets, characterized by the accelerated use of online and social media
        resources for information, entertainment and business and the ubiquitous presence
        of personal mobile devices, has opened new markets for us and our competitors.
        we have aggressively pursued these opportunities by providing our clients
        with the ability to create and distribute media assets from any web access
        point, with an integrated environment that we believe is not available from
        our competitors.\\n\\n\\nwe are currently aware of several major and a number
        of smaller competitors.\u00a0we believe the competitive factors in our market
        include product pricing, features, ease of implementation and use, integration
        with workflow and third-party systems, and the quality of customer support.
        we believe our primary competitors are vizrt limited ag, harris corporation''s
        inscriber subsidiary, miranda technologies, pixel power, orad hi-tec systems
        ltd., avid technology, inc. and ross video ltd. some of these companies have
        significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources
        than we have. on a region-by-region basis, certain product categories or market
        segments in which we operate, or may operate, are dominated by established
        vendors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nintellectual

        of factors could affect our business and financial results. we consider the
        factors described below to be the most significant. there may be other currently
        unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive or other factors
        that could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition
        and results of operations. past financial performance may not be a reliable
        indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to
        anticipate results or trends in future periods. the following discussion of
        risk factors contains \"forward-looking statements,\" as we discuss under
        the heading \"special note regarding forward-looking statements,\" and should
        be read in conjunction with \"item 7. management''s discussion and analysis
        of financial condition and results of operations\" and the consolidated financial
        statements and related notes in this annual report on form 10-k.\\n\\n\\nrisks
        related to our business\\n\\n\\nwe may not realize the benefits of the merger
        with hego because of integration difficulties.\\n\\n\\nit may not be possible
        to realize the full benefits that we anticipated will result from the may
        2013 merger with hego.\u00a0integrating the operations of hego successfully
        or otherwise realizing any of the anticipated benefits of the transaction
        with hego, including anticipated cost savings and additional revenue opportunities,
        involves a number of challenges. the failure to meet these integration challenges
        could seriously harm our results of operations and the market price of our
        common stock may decline as a result.\\n\\n\\nrealizing the benefits of the
        transaction will depend in part on the integration of information technology,
        operations, personnel and sales forces. these integration activities are complex
        and time-consuming and we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected
        costs, including:\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\nour inability to achieve
        the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated in the transaction, which
        would prevent us from achieving the positive earnings gains expected as a

        infrastructures;\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\ncomplexities
        in managing a significantly larger company than before the completion of the
        transaction;\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\ncomplexities associated
        with managing the combined businesses and consolidating multiple physical
        locations where management may determine consolidation is desirable;\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\ndifficulties

        cultures;\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\nchallenges in combining
        product offerings and sales and marketing activities;\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\nchallenges
        in demonstrating to our customers and to customers of hego that the transaction
        will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business
        focus; and\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\npossible cash flow
        interruption or loss of revenue as a result of change of ownership transitional
        matters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\nwe may not successfully integrate the operations
        of the businesses of hego in a timely manner, and we may not realize the anticipated
        net reductions in costs and expenses and other benefits and synergies of the
        transaction of hego to the extent, or in the timeframe, anticipated. in addition
        to the integration risks discussed above, our ability to realize these net
        reductions in costs and expenses and other benefits and synergies could be
        adversely impacted by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine
        operations. as a non-public, non-u.s. company, hego did not have to comply
        with the requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 for internal control
        and other procedures. bringing hego''s systems into compliance with those
        requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional expense. in addition,
        the integration process may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum
        in, the activities of our business. if our management is not able to effectively
        manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities
        are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could
        suffer and our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\\n\u00a0\\ncurrent
        and future economic conditions may adversely affect our business and customers.\\n\\n\\nthe
        united states and other countries in which we operate continue to struggle
        to emerge from economic recessions. this could adversely affect overall spending
        on technology and services and reduce demand or delay payments for our products
        and services. the continuing unfavorable economic environment may also cause
        our customers to have difficulty obtaining capital at adequate or historical
        levels to finance their ongoing business and operations and our customers
        may face insolvency, all of which could impair their ability to make timely
        payments and continue operations. further, we may experience supply chain
        delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints
        faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. we are unable to predict the duration
        and severity of the weakened economic conditions and such conditions could
        adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0

        have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
        of operations.\\n\\n\\nour revenues have fluctuated in the past and may do
        so in the future. in addition, our revenues may not follow any past trends.
        our financial results depend on many factors and may fail to meet our expectations
        for a number of reasons. a variety of factors could cause our revenues to
        fluctuate, including decreased capital spending by our customers, the financial
        health of our customers, changes in customer demand for our products, changes
        in our product mix, the need for continual, rapid new product introductions,
        our degree of success in executing our strategy to develop and market web-based
        content creation solutions, quality and market acceptance of new products
        and services, competitive pricing pressures, the cyclical nature of the broadcast
        industry and other markets in which our products and services are sold, and
        economic conditions affecting our customers and us. any failure to meet expectations
        could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
        and results of operations.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\nif we fail to successfully continue
        to develop, introduce and sell new products and services, then we may be unable
        to compete effectively in the future.\\n\\n\\nwe operate in a highly competitive,
        quickly changing environment marked by rapid obsolescence of existing products.
        our future success depends on our ability to develop, introduce and successfully
        market our workflow and order management system, other new products employing
        the latest technologies, our production and timing and data services, and
        development services for custom high performance solutions that meet the rapidly
        evolving requirements of our customers. our success increasingly depends on
        the ability to cement our position in new segments of the broadcast market.

        we are unable to keep up with rapid change in our industry, our business may
        suffer.\\n\\n\\nthe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly
        changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product
        introductions, enhancements and changes in workflow by our customers, our
        customers'' other vendors and our competitors. due to technological advancements
        and changes in industry standards, our products may become obsolete or the
        prices at which we can sell them may decline. future technological advances
        in the television, video and multimedia industries may result in the availability
        of new products or services that could compete with our products or require
        us to reduce the price of our existing products or services. the availability

        our products and services or in developing, manufacturing or marketing new
        products that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. in addition,
        services, products or technologies developed by others may render our products
        or technologies uncompetitive, unmarketable or obsolete. announcements of
        currently planned or other new product offerings by either our competitors
        or us may cause customers to defer or fail to purchase our existing products
        or services.\\n\\n\\nin addition, it is possible that errors or failures may
        be found in our products. such errors or failures could cause delays in product
        introductions and shipments or require design modifications that could adversely
        affect our sales and our competitive position and could increase warranty
        claims. this could result in an increase in the inventory of our products.
        if we do not develop, on a timely basis, new products and enhancements to
        existing products, or correct errors should they arise, or if such new products
        or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, then our business, financial
        condition and results of operations may suffer. furthermore, the trend toward
        the use of software-based and web-based solutions, including our own hosted
        services, may cause price erosion in our legacy products, create opportunities
        for new competitors, allow existing competitors enhanced opportunities and
        limit the sale of our proprietary systems.\\n\\n\\nwe expend substantial resources
        in developing and selling our products and services, and we may be unable
        to generate significant revenue as a result of these efforts.\\n\\n\\nto establish
        market acceptance of our products and services, we must dedicate significant
        resources to research and development, production, and sales and marketing.
        we experience a delay between the time when we expend these resources and
        the time when we begin to generate revenue, if any, from these expenditures.
        we record as expenses the costs related to the development of new products
        as these expenses are incurred. as a result, our profitability from quarter
        to quarter and from year to year may be materially and adversely affected
        by the number and timing of sales of our existing products and our new product
        introductions in any period, and the level of acceptance gained by these products.\\n\\n\\nour
        results of operations could be adversely affected by impairments of goodwill
        or other long-lived assets and intangible assets.\\n\\n\\nwe recorded $27.9
        million of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet as of december
        31, 2013. goodwill is not amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually
        for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. goodwill is deemed impaired
        to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting
        unit. although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently
        required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill
        impairments that could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0

        to anticipate product opportunities based upon emerging technologies and standards
        and fail to develop products and services that incorporate these technologies
        and standards.\\n\\n\\nwe may spend significant time and money on research
        and development to design and develop products and services around an emerging
        technology or industry standard. if an emerging technology or industry standard
        that we have identified fails to achieve broad market acceptance in our target
        markets, then we may be unable to generate significant revenue from our research
        and development efforts. moreover, even if we are able to develop products
        using adopted standards, then our products may not be accepted in our target
        markets. as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations
        would be materially harmed.\\n\\n\\nif systems manufacturers move away from
        the use of industry standards that we support with our products and adopt
        alternative standards, then we may be unable to design and develop new products
        that conform to these new standards. the expertise required is unique to each
        industry standard, and we would be required to either hire individuals with
        the requisite expertise or acquire this expertise through a licensing arrangement
        or by other means. the demand for individuals with the necessary expertise
        to develop a product relating to a particular industry standard is generally
        high, and we may not be able to hire such individuals. the cost to acquire
        this expertise through licensing or other means may be high and such arrangements
        may not be possible in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms,
        if at all.\u00a0\\n\\n\\nsince most of our systems are microsoft\u00ae windows\u00ae-based,
        we are vulnerable to issues that arise, both anticipated and unanticipated,
        whenever a current version of windows is updated or a new version of windows
        is released. when a windows update is released, lyric, other chyronhego applications
        and/or the graphics systems of our customers may fail to function correctly
        or at all. consequently, we incur expenditures conducting an investigation
        and subsequently, devising a solution. this can be a time- and capital-consuming
        process. when a new version of windows is released, we are forced, against
        our schedule, to rigorously test all of our software and systems using the
        new version, investigate malfunctions and re-engineer our software where necessary.
        this financial and labor expenditure is required in order for us to have the
        ability to officially represent our software and systems as supporting a specific
        version of windows. our revenues and our market share will decline if we do
        not continue to develop and exploit the compatibility of our products with
        windows. most of our systems ship with windows 7 or windows server versions
        that are currently supported with no end of life timelines.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0

        been validated with our proprietary systems, although it can be used with
        selected offline software and hosted applications\\n\\n\\nbecause we rely
        on the implementation of our software and services in windows and other operating
        systems, we are exposed to the vagaries of individual systems or installations
        in which hardware and/or software may interfere with the operation of our
        software and systems, or be interfered with by our software and/or systems,
        and our systems may face exposure to computer viruses. for example, because
        our axis world graphics applications are accessed via an internet web browser,
        we are required to test axis within multiple web browsers including internet
        explorer\u00ae and safari\u00ae running on both current and legacy windows
        and apple\u00ae operating systems. we may spend a significant amount of time
        and resources ensuring that axis functions properly on a wide range of systems
        and within the various operating systems and browsers, and making necessary
        revisions to axis to enable compatibility with new versions of these systems.
        commissioning our systems, software and services in these situations can consume
        time and resources beyond original estimates and consequently reduce our profit
        margins. if we are unable to continue offering our products on the latest
        versions of these browsers and operating systems, then we will not be able
        to generate sales of these products, and our business, financial condition
        and results of operations will be harmed.\\n\\n\\nwe may not successfully
        develop strategic relationships that may be important to our business.\\n\\n\\nwe
        believe the formation of strategic relationships will be important to our
        broadcast offerings. the inability to find strategic partners or the failure
        of any existing relationships to achieve meaningful positive results for us
        could harm our business. we rely in part on strategic relationships to help
        us:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\nmaximize visibility
        and adoption of our products and services through distribution arrangements;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0

        \\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\nincrease the performance, functionality and utility
        of our products and services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmany of these goals have historically
        been beyond our traditional strengths. going forward, we anticipate that we
        may become more reliant on strategic partners to provide multimedia content
        and build the necessary infrastructure for media delivery. in addition, the
        efforts of our strategic partners may be unsuccessful. furthermore, these
        strategic relationships may be terminated before we realize any benefit.\\n\\n\\nwe
        operate in a highly competitive environment and industry and we may lack the
        resources needed to capture increased market share.\\n\\n\\nwe may not be
        able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. the
        markets for digital and broadcast graphics products and services are highly
        competitive. these markets are characterized by constant technological change
        and evolving industry standards. most of our competitors have significantly
        greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we
        have. in addition, certain vendors dominate certain product \\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0
        \\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\ncategories
        and market segments, on a region-by-region basis, in which we currently operate
        or may wish to operate in the future. as a result, our ability to compete
        and operate in these areas may be limited.\\n\\n\\nwe believe that our ability
        to compete depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including
        the success and timing of new product and service offerings introduced by
        us and by our competitors, product performance and price, market presence
        and customer support. we may not be able to compete successfully with respect
        to these factors. maintaining any advantage that we may have, now or in the
        future, over our competitors will require our continuing investments in research
        and development, acquisition and retention of highly skilled personnel, competitive
        analyses, sales and marketing and customer service and support. in addition,
        as we enter new markets, we may encounter distribution channels, technical
        requirements and competitive factors that differ from those in the markets
        in which we currently operate. we may not be able to compete successfully
        in these new markets. increased competition in any of our current markets
        could also result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share,
        any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\n\\nwe
        depend on a limited number of suppliers for several key components, which
        makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain.\\n\u00a0\\nduring
        periods of high demand for electronic products, component shortages are possible,
        and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited.
        if shortages persist, the price of these components may increase, or the components
        may not be available at all. we may not be able to secure enough components
        at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build our products in a timely
        manner, and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources
        can be developed. in addition, certain of our key components are purchased
        from a limited number of suppliers. the development of alternate sources for
        those components is time-consuming, difficult, and costly. furthermore, the
        lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid
        changes in quantities and delivery schedules. in the event of a component
        shortage or supply interruption from our suppliers, we may not be able to
        develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner. if we are unable to
        buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on
        a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver product to our customers, which
        would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\n\\nwe
        may be impacted by new regulations related to conflict minerals.\\n\u00a0\\nin
        august 2012, the sec adopted new rules establishing disclosure and reporting
        requirements regarding the use of certain minerals referred to as \"conflict
        minerals\" in products. these new rules will require us to determine, disclose
        and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic
        republic of the congo or adjoining countries. in addition, these new rules
        could affect our ability to source certain materials used in our hardware
        products at competitive prices and could impact the availability of certain
        minerals used in the manufacture of our hardware products. our customers may
        require that our hardware products be free of conflict minerals, and our revenues
        may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict-\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0

        at a reasonable price. we also expect that there may be costs associated with
        complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining
        the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs related
        to possible changes to our hardware products, processes or sources of supply
        as a consequence of such disclosure and reporting requirements.\\n\\n\\nour
        business will suffer if our network systems fail or become unavailable or
        if security breaches and other disruptions compromise our information.\\n\\n\\nin
        the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data in
        our data centers and on our networks, including intellectual property, our
        proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and
        business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees.
        a reduction in the performance, reliability and availability of our network
        infrastructure would harm our ability to distribute our products and services
        to our users, as well as our reputation and ability to attract and retain
        users and content providers. our systems and operations could be damaged or
        interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, internet
        breakdown, earthquake and similar events. our systems could also be subject
        to viruses, break-ins, sabotage, acts of terrorism, acts of vandalism, hacking,
        cyber-terrorism and similar misconduct which could result in unintentional
        disclosure of proprietary, sensitive or confidential information. such unauthorized
        access could expose us, our customers or the individuals to a risk of loss
        or misuse of information, resulting in litigation or potential liability for
        us.\u00a0although we offer redundant configurations for some of our systems
        and co-locations of our servers to protect our axis world graphics hosted
        services, we do not offer fully redundant configurations across the entire
        product line, nor do we have a formal disaster recovery plan. we might not
        carry adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses
        that may occur from a system outage. any system error or failure that causes
        interruption in availability of products or services or an increase in response
        time could result in a loss of potential or existing customers or content
        providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
        condition and results of operations. if we suffer sustained or repeated interruptions,
        then our products and services could be less attractive to our users and our
        business would be materially harmed.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\nwe depend upon third-party
        dealers to market and sell our products and services and they may discontinue
        sale of our products and services, fail to give our products and services
        priority or be unable to successfully market, sell and support our products
        and services.\\n\\n\\nduring 2013, 21% of our sales were made to third-party
        dealers and independent representatives. although we have contracts with our
        dealers and representatives, any of them may terminate their relationship
        with us on short notice. the loss of one or more of our principal dealers,
        or our inability to attract new dealers, could materially harm our business.
        we may lose dealers in the future and we may be unable to recruit additional
        or replacement dealers. as a result, our future performance will depend in
        part on our ability to retain our existing dealers and representatives and
        attract new dealers and representatives who will be able to sell and support
        our products and services effectively.\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0
        \\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nproblems associated with
        international business operations could subject us to risks from financial,
        operational and political situations, and affect our ability to manufacture
        and sell our products and services.\\n\\n\\nsales to customers located outside
        the united states accounted for 47% of our total sales in 2013 and 33% of
        our total sales in 2012. the increased percentage is primarily a result of
        the merger with hego, which, prior to the merger, derived 93% of its net sales
        in 2012 from sales of its products and services outside the united states.
        we anticipate that sales to customers located outside the united states will
        continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in future periods.
        accordingly, our operations and revenues are subject to a number of risks
        associated with foreign commerce, including the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0
        \\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\nmanaging foreign dealers and foreign customers, which

        operations of foreign-based companies (including potentially negative consequences
        from changes in tax laws (including potential taxes payable on earnings of
        foreign subsidiaries upon repatriation), tariffs, environmental directives,
        freight rates and governmental royalties);\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\ninadequate

        and would cause us to incur expenses associated with obtaining required certifications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin
        addition, we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations,
        which could increase our costs and may adversely affect our results of operations.
        the u.s. dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency
        exchange rate fluctuations. the majority of our foreign-generated revenues
        were generated in europe. significant increases in the value of the u.s. dollar
        relative to foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our
        results of operations.\\n\\n\\nany of these factors may, individually or as
        a group, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
        of operations and cash flows.\\n\\n\\nif we are not able to retain our current
        senior management team or continue to attract and retain qualified technical
        and business personnel, our business will suffer.\\n\\n\\nwe depend on the
        members of our management team for our business success. the loss of any one
        member of our senior management team, including, in particular, johan apel,

        in a significant loss in the knowledge and experience that we, as an organization
        possess and could cause significant delays, or outright failure, in the development
        and commercialization of our products, and could hinder the operation of our
        business. we have an employment agreement with mr. apel, which extends through
        may 23, 2016. the agreement may be terminated by us or mr. apel, with or without
        consent. mr. apel is employed on an at-will basis pursuant to the employment
        agreement. mr. apel may be entitled to severance payments under certain circumstances.
        mr. apel is subject to change-in-control provisions pursuant to the employment
        agreement. three other members of our senior management team are subject to
        employment agreements that expire in 2014 or 2016. the loss of the services
        of mr. apel or any member of our senior management team may delay or prevent
        us from achieving our objectives.\\n\\n\\nin addition, we believe our future
        success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain engineers and other
        highly skilled personnel and sales people. most of our employees are at-will
        and only a few are subject to employment contracts. hiring qualified sales
        and technical personnel will be difficult due to the limited number of qualified
        professionals. competition for these types of employees is high. we have in
        the past experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified sales
        and technical personnel necessary for the development of our business. failure
        to attract and retain personnel, particularly sales and technical personnel,
        would materially harm our business.\\n\\n\\nwe may not be able to protect
        our proprietary technology and may be sued for infringing on the rights of
        others.\\n\\n\\nprotection of intellectual property rights is crucial to our
        business, because that is how we prevent others from copying innovations that
        are central to our existing and future products. our success also depends,
        in part, upon our ability to operate without infringing upon the rights of
        others. we rely on a combination of methods to protect our proprietary intellectual
        property, technology and body of knowledge, such as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0
        \\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\ntrade secret laws;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\u00b7\\n\\n\\ncopyright

        technology and security measures.\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbecause it is critical
        to our success that we are able to prevent competitors from copying our innovations,
        we intend to continue to seek patent and trade secret protection for our products
        where available and when we deem appropriate. the process of seeking patent
        protection can be long and expensive, and we cannot be certain that any currently
        pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or
        that, even if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength
        to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. we also
        intend to continue to seek trademark status for our product/service brand
        names and \\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0
        \\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\ntechnologies, in order to prevent our competitors
        from co-opting these brand names for their own use.\u00a0\\n\\n\\nexisting
        copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws afford only limited protection.
        moreover, effective protection of copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and
        other proprietary rights may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign
        countries and territories. domestic and foreign laws, in combination with
        the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, may not be adequate
        to prevent misappropriation of our technology or other proprietary rights.
        the steps we have taken regarding our proprietary technology may not be sufficient
        to deter misappropriation; for example, we have rights in trademarks, service
        marks and copyrights that are not registered. we also rely on trade secret
        protection for our technology, in part through confidentiality agreements
        with our employees, consultants and third parties; however, employees may
        breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
        also, the copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws we rely upon
        to protect our intellectual property do not preclude competitors from independently
        developing products with functionality or features similar or superior to
        our products and technologies, or designing around the patents we own or the
        technology we create.\\n\\n\\nin the systems and software industries, companies
        receive notices from time to time alleging infringement of patents, copyrights
        or other intellectual property rights of others. in the past we have been,
        and may from time to time continue to be, notified of claims that we may be
        infringing patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of third
        parties. companies may pursue claims against us with respect to the alleged
        infringement of patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights
        of third parties. in addition, litigation may be necessary to protect our
        intellectual property rights and trade secrets, to determine the validity
        of and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against third-party
        claims of infringement. any litigation could result in substantial costs and
        diversion of resources from the day-to-day operation of our business.\\n\\n\\nif
        a new law or regulation is adopted pertaining to the telecommunications and
        television industries, it could harm our customers'' business, which could
        have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
        of operations.\\n\\n\\nthe enactment by u.s. federal or state or international
        governments of new laws or regulations, changes in the interpretation of existing
        regulations or a reversal of the trend toward deregulation in these industries
        could cause our customers to suffer, and thereby adversely affect our business,
        financial condition and results of operations. television operators are subject
        to extensive government regulation by the fcc and other u.s. federal and state
        regulatory agencies. these regulations could limit capital expenditures by
        television operators and if that occurs, our business, financial condition
        and results of operations may suffer.\\n\\n\\nthe telecommunications and television
        industries are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and other
        countries. our business is dependent upon the continued growth of these industries
        in the united states and internationally. recent legislation has lowered the
        legal barriers to entry for companies into the united states'' multi-channel
        television market, but telecommunications companies may not successfully enter
        this or related markets. moreover, the \\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0

        internationally is dependent in part on similar deregulation of the telecommunications
        industry abroad and such deregulation may not occur.\u00a0\\n\\n\\nwe are
        uncertain of our ability to obtain financing for our future needs, and liquidity
        issues have and may continue to increase our cost of capital.\\n\\n\\nat december
        31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.3 million and working capital
        of $1.2 million. we entered into a two-year credit facility with a u.s. bank
        in november 2013. the credit facility provides for a $4.0 million revolving
        line of credit with an advance rate of the lesser of $4.0 million or 80% of
        eligible accounts receivable, less the amount outstanding under the credit
        facility. we also have revolving credit facilities associated with our european
        operations that total $1.3 million, of which $0.9 million was outstanding
        at december 31, 2013. these revolving credit facilities have expiration dates
        of december 31, 2014 and automatically renew for twelve month periods unless
        notified by the lender ninety days prior to expiration. we believe that cash
        on hand, net cash expected to be generated in the business, and the amount
        available under our lines of credit, will be sufficient to meet our needs
        for at least the next twelve months if we are able to achieve our planned
        results of operations and retain the availability of credit under our credit
        facilities. however, we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund
        our business, expand our sales and marketing activities, develop or enhance
        new products and services, respond to competitive pressures and satisfy our
        existing and any new obligations that may arise. we could be in default under
        our u.s. credit facility with our bank if: (i) we fail to make payment of
        principal and interest when due; (ii) we fail to provide to our bank required
        financial statements, reports and certificates; fail to timely file all required
        tax returns and pay timely; fail to maintain required insurance policies at
        levels acceptable to the bank; fail to maintain our primary operating bank
        accounts with the bank; fail to meet our financial covenants; or fail to comply
        with the required negative covenants; (iii) we incur a material adverse change
        in our business, operations or condition; if there is a material impairment
        in the perfection or priority of the bank''s lien on the collateral supporting
        the credit facility; if there is a material impairment of the prospect of
        repayment of our obligations to the bank; or the bank determines that there
        is a reasonable likelihood that we will fail to comply with one or more of
        our financial covenants in the succeeding financial reporting period; (iv)
        we become insolvent; (v) are issued a judgment for payment of $100,000 or
        more net of insurance recovery if any; and (vi) other events of default as
        described in our amended and restated loan and security agreement, as amended,
        with our bank.\u00a0in the event of default, the bank''s remedies include
        any or all of the following:\u00a0(i) declare all outstanding obligations
        to the bank, due and payable; (ii) stop advances or credit under the credit
        facility; (iii) require that we deposit cash in an amount of at least 105%
        of the dollar amount of any outstanding letters of credit; (iv) terminate
        any foreign exchange contracts; (v) dispose of collateral adequate to repay
        the bank any amounts owed to it; and (vi) take additional measures, as outlined
        in the loan and security agreement, as amended, to protect the bank''s interests.
        additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at
        all. capital is critical to our business, and our ability to raise capital
        in the event that losses use our available cash would have a material adverse
        effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0

        in discount rates, the actual return on pension assets and other factors could
        adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\n\\nour
        business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively
        impacted by the amount of expense recorded related to our qualified pension
        plan.\u00a0accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\"gaap\")
        require that income or expense related to the pension plan be calculated at
        the annual measurement date using actuarial calculations, which reflect certain
        assumptions. the most significant of these assumptions relate to interest
        rates, the capital markets and other economic conditions. changes in key economic
        indicators can change these assumptions.\u00a0these assumptions, as well as
        the actual value of pension assets at the measurement date, will impact the
        calculation of pension expense for the year. although gaap expense and pension
        contributions are not directly related, the key economic indicators that affect
        gaap expense also affect the amount of cash that we will contribute to our
        pension plan.\u00a0because the values of these pension assets have fluctuated
        and will continue to fluctuate in response to changing market conditions,
        the amount of gains or losses that will be recognized in subsequent periods,
        the impact on the funded status of the pension plan and the future minimum
        required contributions, if any, could adversely affect our business, financial
        condition and results of operations.\\n\\n\\nour principal shareholders have

        could occur, could adversely affect the market price for our common stock
        as it would result in additional shares of our common stock being available
        on the public market. these issuances or sales also might make it difficult
        for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that
        we deem appropriate.\u00a0\\n\\n\\nwe have various mechanisms in place to

        of compliance again in the future. if we fail to maintain compliance with
        any listing requirements, we could be delisted and our common stock would
        be considered a penny stock under regulations of the sec and would therefore
        be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on
        broker-dealers who sell our securities. the additional burdens imposed upon

        1.businessgeneralf5 networks is the leading developer and provider of software-defined
        application services. these services deliver our customers with the most secure,
        fast and reliable applications to any user, anywhere, anytime. our core technology
        is a full-proxy, programmable, massively-scalable software platform called
        tmos (traffic management operating system).introduced in 2004, the tmos platform
        supports the industry\u2019s broadest array of features and functions designed
        to ensure that applications accessible over internet protocol (ip) networks
        are secure, fast and available. our tmos-based application services include
        local and global traffic management, network and application security, access
        management, web acceleration and a number of other network and application
        services. these services are available as software modules that can run individually
        or as part of an integrated solution on our high-performance, scalable, purpose-built
        big-ip appliances and chassis-based viprion systems, or as software-only virtual
        editions that run on all major hypervisors. in conjunction with our big-iq
        management software, the availability of our products as both hardware-based
        and software-only solutions gives customers the flexibility to create a dynamic
        control plane infrastructure tailored to the specific demands of private and
        public clouds as well as traditional data centers.the core features and functions
        of tmos enable our products to inspect and modify the content of ip traffic
        flows between users and applications and support a broad and growing array
        of services. irules, a scripting language based on tool command language (tcl),
        is a unique feature of tmos that enables customers and third parties to write
        customized rules to inspect and modify traffic. tmos also has an open software
        interface called icontrol, which allows our products to communicate with one
        another and with third-party products, and a scripting framework called icall
        that lets users define data 3table of contentsplane events such as threshold
        breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly. tmos is designed
        to support the addition of new functionality as software modules and to exploit
        the performance-enhancing features of our purpose-built hardware.our hardware
        products include our big-ip family of appliances and our line of scalable
        viprion systems. these purpose-built devices integrate industry-standard components,
        such as general-purpose processors and fpgas (field-programmable gate arrays),
        with components we design ourselves. the architecture of these systems is
        designed to accelerate and optimize the performance of our software by offloading
        repetitive, compute-intensive functions such as encryption and compression
        to specific components, and enabling complex application-layer processing
        at network speed. typically deployed in front of web and application servers,
        our hardware products deliver massive performance and scalability that enable
        customers to consolidate multiple application services on a single device.
        this eliminates the need for separate point products, which are often difficult
        and costly to integrate and manage and reduces the load on servers by offloading
        functions that might otherwise run on the servers themselves. offloading functions
        from servers reduces the number of servers needed to run specific applications,
        lowers the cost of power and cooling, and drives down operating costs by simplifying
        the management of servers and applications. in virtual environments, this
        allows customers to increase the density of virtual servers and reduces the
        added complexity of managing a dynamic environment.as information technology
        infrastructures continue to evolve, there is growing demand for software-only
        application services that can be deployed in virtual environments next to
        each instance of an application. for customers who prefer this option, our
        virtual edition (ve) products offer faster throughput than competing products
        and the broadest array of integrated application services available. we sell
        individual ve versions of all modules available on our hardware-based solutions
        which provide the same software services and include all of the features and
        functions embedded in tmos.while ves have lower performance than our hardware-based
        solutions, they give customers the flexibility to deploy a mix of integrated
        application services as needed, spinning them up and down with each instance
        of an application, and moving them with the application between traditional
        data centers and private or public clouds. both ves and hardware-based services
        can be and increasingly are deployed in hybrid infrastructures within data
        centers and private clouds, across multiple data centers, and across data
        centers and public clouds. our big-iq management platform supports an array
        of software modules that enable customers to manage all of the services running
        in these hybrid environments from a single management console.in addition
        to our tmos-based products, we offer other closely-related products that facilitate,
        enhance, or extend our application services. our traffix family of diameter
        signaling and routing products, acquired in february 2012, offers the most
        advanced, robust and cost-effective solution for diameter routing, load balancing
        and gateway connectivity, enabling service providers to meet the multiple
        challenges associated with the growth of mobile data.linerate software-defined
        application services, acquired in early 2013, address the growing demand for
        network functions virtualization (nfv) and network service virtualization
        (nsv) by enabling application developers and network operators (devops) to
        rapidly create and deploy complex networking functions that help scale, manage,
        and optimize their applications.more recent acquisitions include technologies
        that complement and expand our security offerings. versafe software products
        (websafe and mobilesafe), acquired in september 2013, provide real-time protection
        against malware, phishing, and other cyber-threats aimed at mobile devices
        and web applications. defense.net, acquired last may, is a cloud-based service
        that provides highly scalable protection against distributed denial of service
        (ddos) attacks and complements our existing on-premise ddos protection capabilities.another
        recent addition to our security offerings, secure web gateway services is
        integrated with websense cloud-based services to protect enterprises against
        inbound and outbound malware. in addition, f5 provides a threat intelligence
        feed, called ip intelligence (ipi), by leveraging webroot\u2019s brightcloud
        honeypots, sensors and endpoints all across the internet which aggregate millions
        of malicious addresses into a reputation database. websafe, mobilesafe, defense.net,

        large business and government organizations have been gradually replacing
        older data center architectures with ip-based infrastructures, deploying new
        ip-based applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with
        new ip-enabled versions. at the same time, organizations have become more
        geographically dispersed, and increasingly mobile workforces depend on access
        to corporate applications and data from remote locations and a variety of
        client devices including smartphones, tablets and laptops.in recent years,
        the information technology landscape has changed dramatically as organizations
        have responded to the slowdown in the global economy by using technologies
        such as virtualization, software defined networking and the growing availability
        and sophistication of cloud computing to reduce capital and operating costs
        and enhance the flexibility and efficiency of their information infrastructures.
        these efforts are reflected in the ongoing trend toward data center consolidation
        that includes a reduction in the number and size of data centers, as well
        as the number and variety of hardware devices. in addition, a growing number
        of organizations are turning to social networking and other online vehicles
        to help target customers and compete more effectively in an environment of
        reduced consumer spending. emergence of the dynamic data centerfrom a broad
        perspective, the goal of it organizations is to optimize the secure delivery
        of applications to users wherever they are and whenever they need them. to
        achieve these goals, it organizations are embracing virtualization technologies
        that enable them to group or partition data center resources to meet user
        demand and reconfigure these virtual resources easily and quickly as demand
        changes. the recent surge of interest in software defined networks highlights
        the latest move to reduce costs, increase the flexibility, and simplify the
        deployment and management of it infrastructure through virtualization. many
        organizations are also taking advantage of the growing availability of external
        cloud resources as a flexible, secure and reliable alternative to owning and
        managing everything themselves. as a result, it infrastructure has become
        increasingly dynamic, complex and reliant on ip-based networks for the delivery
        of applications and data. at the same time, these changes have created new
        challenges to the security of ip networks and the applications and data accessible
        over the internet. with increasing frequency, sophisticated denial of service
        attacks have exposed a major vulnerability in the security perimeter of corporate
        networks by overwhelming firewalls and effectively shutting down the networks.
        in addition, many network-level security threats are directly related to the
        improper use of the same protocols applications depend on to transmit data
        over the wire. intrusion detection and prevention devices, which rely on signature
        databases of known threats, afford some protection against these types of
        attack. however, they offer no protection against many of the most common
        threats, including information leakage, content spoofing, cross-site request
        forgery or \u201cday zero\u201d attacks designed to exploit a variety of application
        vulnerabilities.in addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to
        disrupt, destroy or block access to network applications, organizations are
        faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications
        and data. the proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones,
        tablets, and laptops the ability to access corporate private and public data
        centers from virtually anywhere. this, in turn, has increased the difficulty
        of ensuring that mobile users are able to access applications and data for
        which they are authorized, and that applications and data are protected from
        access by unauthorized users.need to optimize the secure delivery of applications
        and datawith the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of it infrastructures,
        there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and
        data over ip networks. ip-based traffic passing between end-user devices and
        servers is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to
        their destination where they are reassembled. the disassembly, routing, and
        reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little
        intelligence. by contrast, managing, inspecting, modifying, redirecting and
        securing application traffic going to and from servers requires intelligent
        systems capable of performing a broad array of functions. broadly speaking,
        all of those functions are aspects of application delivery.application delivery
        controllers, or adcs, dynamically manage the flow of traffic between users
        and servers (physical or virtual), making multiple servers look like a single
        resource to the user. in addition they free up resources by offloading 5table
        of contentscommon network functions, such as encryption, ipv4/ipv6 translation,
        compression, authentication, rate-shaping, and a variety of specialized functions,
        including network and application security services, policy management, and
        wan optimization, that would otherwise run on the servers or be coded into
        applications. since most large enterprises have hundreds\u00a0\u2014 if not
        thousands\u00a0\u2014 of servers and applications, it is not practical to
        replicate these functions on each server or within each virtual instance of
        an application. doing so would take up valuable network resources and reduce
        the number of applications that could run on each server. maintenance costs
        would be prohibitive and the net result would be a negative impact on the
        overall performance of servers and applications. offloading specific functions
        onto point solutions can eliminate those problems but introduces a new set
        of challenges. using point solutions from multiple vendors can create interoperability
        issues, and problems that do occur can be difficult to troubleshoot. from
        a security standpoint, it is also much more difficult to audit traffic passing
        through multiple devices. providing a comprehensive set of integrated application
        delivery services on a single, high-performance device simplifies management
        of the device and the servers it sits in front of and reduces overall capital
        and operating costs. in virtual and cloud environments where flexibility is
        a priority, software-only adcs provide the same services and many of the benefits
        associated with hardware-based adcs.although application delivery services
        are broadly applicable within enterprise and service provider it infrastructures,
        the latter face unique challenges as they attempt to modernize and scale their
        networks to deal with the flood of data generated by smart phones, tablets,
        wearables and other mobile devices. to cope with these challenges, service
        providers are migrating legacy 2g/3g infrastructures to 4g/lte networks and
        evolved packet core (epc) data centers that require an array of network and
        application services. today, most of those services are deployed on separate
        appliances from different vendors. apart from the associated capital costs,
        integrating and managing multiple devices entail significant operating expense,
        and service providers are actively seeking solutions that will enable them
        to lower costs and improve reliability and performance by consolidating services
        and reducing the number of devices. to cope with the dramatic increase in
        signaling traffic associated with 4g/lte networks and the multi-vendor technology
        interoperability challenges, service providers have also adopted the diameter
        signaling protocol as the de facto standard for communication within their
        evolving data center infrastructure. diameter signaling solutions offer unprecedented
        scalability, reliability, and performance on a single, carrier-grade, purpose-built
        platform.f5\u2019s strategyour goal is to lead the industry in providing application
        and network services that ensure the safe, fast and reliable delivery of applications
        to any user, anywhere, anytime. those services include availability, security,
        performance, mobility, and identity. they also include managing and orchestrating
        resources, as well as coordinating services across multiple data centers and
        networks. our products are designed to be strategic points of control in the
        it infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information
        is exchanged. this enables organizations to respond quickly to changing business
        needs, improve costly and time consuming business processes and develop new
        sources of revenue through highly differentiated offerings. key components
        of our strategy include:offering a complete, integrated application delivery
        product suite.since the introduction of tmos, we have developed tmos-based
        versions of our own legacy products, such as local traffic manager (ltm),
        global traffic manager (gtm) and link controller; new products, such as advanced
        firewall manager (afm), carrier grade network address translation (cgnat)
        and policy enforcement manager (pem), that leverage the unique performance
        characteristics of our hardware and software architecture; and products that
        incorporate acquired technology, including application security manager (asm),
        application acceleration manager (aam), access policy manager (apm) and two
        of our newest security offerings, websafe and mobilesafe. all of these products
        are currently available as integrated software modules on our big-ip and viprion
        hardware and as virtual editions that run on any standard server or hypervisor.
        we believe this approach sharply differentiates our products from our competitors\u2019
        offerings and provides customers with an expanding array of integrated application
        delivery solutions that can be customized to meet their specific needs.investing
        in technology to meet evolving customer needs.we continue to invest in research
        and development to provide our customers with comprehensive, integrated application
        delivery services. our product development efforts leverage the unique attributes
        of our tmos platform to deliver new features and functions that address the
        complex, changing needs of our customers. although the bulk of our investment
        is software development, concurrent development of tightly integrated, high-performance
        hardware is a key part of our investment strategy. we also look for opportunities
        to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings
        and expand into adjacent markets.6table of contentsexpanding our addressable
        market.since the introduction of tmos, we have continually expanded our addressable
        market and the definition of application delivery through the acquisition
        and development of new technology. in 2003, for example, we entered the market
        for secure remote access through the acquisition of uroam, inc. and its firepass
        ssl vpn technology that has become the core of our current access policy manager
        (apm) offering. the following year we entered the web application firewall
        market with the acquisition of magnifire websystems, inc. and its trafficshield
        security appliance, which became the foundation of our application security
        manager (asm). by leveraging the programmability, full proxy capabilities,
        and built-in security features of tmos, customers were also able to exploit
        the performance and scalability of our products and deploy them as icsa-certified
        network firewalls. in march 2013, we introduced advanced firewall manager
        (afm), a new software module that simplifies the deployment and management
        of our products as network firewalls, and big-iq security, a management framework
        that lets customers administer policies and manage afm across all of their
        f5 platforms. in september 2013, we continued to expand our security solution
        with the acquisition of versafe, a provider of web anti-fraud, anti-phishing,
        and anti-malware solutions, and in may 2014 we acquired defense.net, which
        provides cloud-based ddos protection that complements our on-premise ddos
        solution. while each of these products addresses a different segment of the
        broader security market, they are all integral components of our comprehensive
        security offering and tightly integrated with ltm and the other features and
        functions available on our products. as a result of this strategy and our
        development and acquisition of technology in other related markets such as
        wan optimization, java script programming, and diameter signaling and routing,
        we believe our current addressable market is significantly larger than the
        adc market as industry analysts have traditionally defined it.continuing to
        build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners.to enhance
        our competitiveness in large accounts, we have developed strategic technology
        partnerships with enterprise software vendors, such as microsoft, oracle,
        vmware and others, who have an established presence in those accounts. by
        taking advantage of icontrol, our open application programming interface,
        and icall, a scripting framework that provides the ability to define data
        plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products
        accordingly, these vendors can equip their applications to control our products
        in the network, enhancing overall application performance. in return, they
        provide us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our
        products to their customers. we have also worked closely with several of these
        vendors to develop configurations of our products, called iapps, that are
        specifically designed to simplify deployment and optimize the performance
        of their applications. these solutions are available as templates which allow
        quick and easy configuration of our products for specific applications. during
        the past year we have entered into partnerships with cisco, hp, microsoft
        and vmware to provide integrated application services for their software defined
        networking (sdn) offerings. in addition, we have established partnerships
        with microsoft azure, vmware vcloud air, amazon web services and many others
        to provide cloud-based application services and solutions. we plan to continue
        building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge
        by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders.leveraging
        devcentral, our online community of network architects and developers.customization
        of our tmos-based products using irules and our linerate technology with node.js
        enhances their \u201cstickiness\u201d by allowing customers to solve problems
        in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not
        impossible to solve by other means. to promote the use of irules and node.js,
        we host an online community, devcentral, where network architects and developers
        can discuss and share the ways in which they use irules and node.js to solve
        problems and enhance the security, performance and availability of applications.
        a corollary benefit is that many of the irules solutions posted by devcentral
        participants have become standard features in new releases of tmos. devcentral
        also provides a valuable window into our customers\u2019 constantly evolving
        needs.f5 solutionsour integrated family of tmos-based network and application
        services is comprised of software products that run on purpose-built hardware
        and are also available as virtual (software-only) editions or ves. these products
        function as strategic points of control in ip networks, inspecting, modifying
        and directing traffic to optimize the security, availability and delivery
        of applications and data to any user, anywhere, anytime. our linerate technology
        supports similar functionality in software-only solutions designed to meet
        the specialized needs of software-defined data centers. our traffix diameter
        signaling and routing devices address the complex needs of service providers
        by enabling fast, reliable communications among the elements of their legacy
        infrastructures and their evolving packet-based 4g/lte networks and data centers.
        we believe our products offer the most intelligent services and advanced functionality
        in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations
        to simplify management of their ip networks and data center operations by
        integrating disparate resources to reduce operating costs, enhance productivity
        and improve service to employees, customers and partners.7table of contentsapplication
        deliverysince 2004 we have expanded the breadth of features and functionality
        we offer well beyond the scope of application delivery networking as it has
        been traditionally defined. today, we also offer solutions that include application
        security, secure remote access, firewall protection, wan optimization, access
        policy management, carrier grade network address translation, diameter signaling
        policy enforcement, and fraud detection opening up large opportunities in
        several adjacent markets. many of the features and functions that differentiate
        our products are built into tmos, our full-proxy operating system. others
        are available as software modules that run on tmos or as virtual editions,
        and some of our newer security services are available by subscription.softwarethe
        core of our application delivery technology is tmos, our traffic management
        operating system, introduced in september 2004. the full-proxy characteristics
        of the tmos architecture enable our products to intercept, inspect and act
        on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of ip-enabled application.
        in addition, the modularity of the tmos architecture allows us to deliver
        tightly integrated solutions that secure, optimize and ensure the availability
        of applications and the networks they\u00a0run\u00a0on.traffic management
        operating system (tmos)since tmos was launched, we have added hundreds of
        new features designed to interpret and act on specific content in the traffic
        passing between users and applications. tmos includes several features and
        functions that are unique to our products:\u2022iapps is a set of portable,
        customizable, reusable templates that enable the rapid and predictable deployment
        of our products in front of dozens of applications from vendors including
        microsoft, oracle, vmware, citrix, bea, and sap. iapps also allows customers
        and partners to create templates that simplify the deployment and provisioning
        of their own applications.\u2022icall is a control plane scripting framework
        that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches
        and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly. icall enables administrators
        to react to specified data plane events by executing services on the management
        plane. it can also be used periodically to manage backups or repopulate dns,
        or to provide regularly scheduled services such as configuration audits.\u2022scalen
        is a set of three unique capabilities that enhance the flexibility of our
        products:\u25e6clustered multiprocessing (cmp) allows customers to cluster
        and aggregate processors (cores) within big-ip appliances or viprion chassis
        products.\u25e6virtual clustered multiprocessing (vcmp) enables the creation
        of separate virtual adcs within an appliance or chassis, each running a separate
        instance of tmos with a different configuration and assigned to a different
        application.\u25e6device service clustering (dsc) gives customers the ability
        to group devices and services across an array of adcs (big-ip appliances,
        viprion chassis, or virtual editions). devices can be added to or removed
        from a dsc without disrupting application services, and application services
        can be independently managed within the cluster. tmos also includes a number
        of new security features that enhance the ability of our products to protect
        and hide networks and applications from denial of service attacks and other
        types of security threats. other enhancements include gateway support for
        software defined networks (sdn) -- both vxlan and nvgre -- symmetrical and
        asymmetrical application acceleration, subscriber and application aware enforcement
        for service providers, management and orchestration of multiple devices, and
        improved visibility that allows customers to monitor and record the performance
        of applications and users.product modulesin addition to the features and functions
        embedded in tmos, we offer a family of integrated software solutions that
        cover a broad range of application-aware network functions from load-balancing
        to security. depending on a number of factors, including the hardware platform
        they have purchased, the application they are running, and their performance
        and security requirements, customers may purchase one or more of these modules
        in addition to local traffic manager (ltm), which is included with every product.
        the following software modules are currently available on all big-ip and viprion
        products except big-ip 2000:8table of contents\u2022local traffic manager
        (ltm): ltm, which provides intelligent load-balancing and traffic management,
        is standard on all big-ip appliances, viprion chassis-based systems and virtual
        editions. as a strategic point of control between applications and users,
        ltm manages the flow and distribution of all traffic passing through our products,
        ensuring that applications are secure, fast and available.\u2022global traffic
        manager (gtm): gtm automatically directs users to the closest or best-performing
        data center based on business policy, geolocation, and volume spikes, regardless
        of their cause. when users try to access a data center that is overloaded
        or unreachable, gtm automatically and seamlessly directs them to a secondary
        data center. it also automates the process of tracking and managing interdependencies
        among individual services in distributed applications. in addition, gtm enhances
        dns security by automatically scaling to absorb a rapid increase in queries
        resulting from a denial of service attack.\u2022link controller: for organizations
        with more than one internet service provider (isp), link controller monitors
        the health and availability of each connection. in the event of a failure,
        traffic is dynamically directed across other available links so users and
        external customers stay connected. link controller includes an optional compression
        feature that reduces wan link bandwidth for lower isp costs and cuts down
        on bandwidth bottlenecks for faster application delivery.\u2022advanced firewall
        manager (afm): afm is a high-performance, stateful, full-proxy network firewall
        designed to guard data centers against incoming threats that enter the network
        on the most widely deployed protocols-including http/s, smtp, dns, and ftp.
        by aligning firewall policies with the applications they protect, afm streamlines
        application deployment, security, and monitoring.\u2022application security
        manager (asm): asm is an application firewall that provides comprehensive,
        proactive, application-layer protection against both generalized and targeted
        attacks. combining a positive security model (\u201cdeny all unless allowed\u201d)
        with signature-based detection, asm can prevent \u201cday-zero\u201d attacks
        in addition to known security threats.\u2022access policy manager (apm): apm
        provides secure, granular, context-aware access to networks and applications
        while simplifying authentication, authorization, and accounting (aaa) management.
        our endpoint security service validates client devices, including personal
        devices used by employees to access corporate applications and data, to protect
        organizations from viruses or malware infections, accidental data loss, and
        rogue device access. this allows users to apply repeatable access policies
        across many devices, networks, applications and servers with centralized visibility
        of their authorization infrastructure.\u2022application acceleration manager
        (aam): aam combines the application delivery features previously available
        in wan optimization manager (wom) and webaccelerator. aam overcomes network,
        protocol, and application issues to help meet application performance, data
        replication, and disaster recovery requirements presented by cloud, mobile
        applications, and video distribution, decreasing the need for additional bandwidth
        and hardware and giving users fast access to applications.\u2022carrier-grade
        network address translation (cgnat): cgnat offers a broad set of tools that
        enables service providers to successfully migrate to ipv6 while continuing
        to support and interoperate with existing ipv4 devices and content. big-ip
        cgnat offers service providers tunneling solutions with dual-stack lite capabilities
        as well as native network address translation solutions such as nat44 and
        nat64. it provides carrier-grade scalability by offering a very high number
        of ip address translations, very fast nat translation setup rates, high throughput,
        and high-speed logging.\u2022policy enforcement manager (pem): pem offers
        service providers a comprehensive set of traffic classification capabilities
        to accurately identify the specific applications and services subscribers
        are using and how they\u2019re using them. this information allows them to
        steer application and subscriber traffic to the most appropriate value-added
        services (such as web caching, video optimization, or parental control) and
        reduce the burden on other services. pem also provides deep reporting, enabling
        service providers to build tailored services and packages based on subscribers\u2019
        application usage and traffic classification.virtual adcsall of our product
        modules are also available as software-only virtual editions (ves), designed
        to run on all major hypervisors. production ves are deployed in public and
        private clouds and supplement our hardware products in hybrid environments.
        trial versions give our customers a cost-effective way to test and configure
        our products and help determine which systems and modules will best meet their
        specific needs in production environments.nfv and nsv productsour linerate
        products address the growing demand for network functions virtualization (nfv)
        and network service virtualization (nsv) by providing application developers
        and network operators with tools to leverage a vast library of open-9table
        of contentssource services that run on standard hypervisors and commodity
        servers. using the power and flexibility of node.js, a server-side version
        of javascript, linerate products enable developers and operations personnel
        (devops) to rapidly create and deploy a broad range of complex networking
        functions that help scale, manage, and optimize their applications.software
        as a serviceamong our newest security offerings, websafe and mobilesafe are
        software modules that inject code into traffic between servers and end-user
        devices which is then downloaded transparently to the device and provides
        real-time protection against malware, phishing, and other cyberthreats, including
        fraud without any impact to the user experience. as their names imply, websafe
        protects against all web-based threat types, and mobilesafe protects against
        advanced threats targeting the mobile user. defense.net, our most recent acquisition
        and our newest security offering, is a cloud-based service that provides highly
        scalable protection against ddos attacks. deployed in conjunction with our

        hardware products are designed to enhance the performance of our software.
        currently we offer two types of hardware configurations: big-ip appliances;
        and our chassis-based viprion products. both big-ip and viprion run tmos and
        support all of our product software modules. we also sell specialty appliances
        that integrate specific software services and are only available as standalone
        products.data sheets for all of our hardware platforms are available in the
        products section of our website.big-ip appliancesproducts in our family of
        big-ip application delivery controllers differ primarily in their performance
        characteristics resulting from the hardware components and configurations
        that make up each system. during fiscal year 2013, we revamped our entire
        family of big-ip appliances. the new line is comprised of the big-ip 2000
        series, big-ip 4000 series, big-ip 5000 series, big-ip 7000 series and big-ip

        interoperability of legacy and next-generation networks, mobile and fixed
        elements, and all third-party vendors. management and orchestration\u2022big-iq
        is an intelligent management framework that simplifies the process of deploying
        and optimizing our application delivery services. analogous to tmos, big-iq
        is a software platform designed to support multiple management modules. currently
        we offer three big-iq modules:\u25e6big-iq device lets customers manage all
        their f5 systems and ves across their entire infrastructure. big-iq device
        provides device inventory, status, backups, updates, upgrades and license
        management from a single management console.\u25e6big-iq cloud automates and
        orchestrates the deployment of application delivery services on f5 products
        across traditional data centers or public, private, and hybrid cloud infrastructures,
        enabling customers to deploy and manage application delivery services in a
        fast, consistent, and repeatable manner, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.\u25e6big-iq
        security consolidates firewall policy management across multiple advanced
        firewall manager (afm) devices, reducing it overhead and increasing operational
        scalability by letting customers create new firewall policies, modify existing
        policies, push policy changes to selected firewall devices and monitor the
        effectiveness of each device from a single point of control.big-iq is designed
        with an industry leading and open set of api\u2019s, which integrates with
        northbound orchestrators such as openstack, cisco\u2019s aci, microsoft\u2019s
        scvmm and vmware\u2019s nsx, vcac and vco allowing greater flexibility in
        supporting hyper-converged data centers and infrastructure.product developmentwe
        believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership
        by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet
        the changing needs of our customers. our product development organization
        employs a standard process for the development, documentation and quality
        control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals. this
        process includes working with our business development and marketing teams,
        product managers, customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions
        that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets.our principal software
        engineering team is located at our headquarters in seattle, washington. product
        development for apm, pem and aam is located in san\u00a0jose, california.
        asm, traffix sdc and versafe product development is located in tel aviv, israel.
        our hardware engineering team is located in spokane, washington. in addition,
        we maintain a dedicated facility for product testing and quality control in
        tomsk, russia. members of all our product development teams collaborate closely
        with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware
        and software systems.during the fiscal years ended september\u00a030, 2014,
        2013 and 2012, we had research and product development expenses of $263.8
        million, $209.6 million, and $177.4 million, respectively.customersour customers
        include a wide variety of enterprises and service providers among fortune
        1000\u00a0and business week global 1000\u00a0companies, including those in
        technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education,
        manufacturing and healthcare, along with government customers. in fiscal year
        2014, sales outside of the americas represented 11table of contents43.1% of
        our net revenues. refer to note\u00a010 of our consolidated financial statements
        included in this annual report on form\u00a010-k for additional information
        regarding our revenues by geographic area.sales and marketingsaleswe sell
        our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers
        through a variety of channels, including distributors, value-added resellers
        (vars) and systems integrators. a substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal
        year 2014 was derived from these channel sales. our sales teams work closely
        with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly
        to major accounts.early in fiscal 2014, we introduced new pricing options
        for our hardware and software designed to simplify the sales process and provide
        incentives for customers to purchase more of our software products. good,
        better, best (gbb) is a tiered licensing model that is available for our big-ip
        appliances, viprion chassis products, and virtual editions (ves). \u2022good
        is our basic traffic management option that includes big-ip ltm along with
        the full suite of features and functions available on tmos. additional software
        modules can be purchased at the list price for each module or ve.\u2022better
        includes three modules or ves (gtm, aam and afm) in addition to ltm at a discount
        to what they would cost if each were purchased separately.\u2022best includes
        gtm, aam and afm plus our two most popular software products, asm and apm,
        also at a discount to what they would cost if purchased separately.pricing
        for the modules scales with the size of the system purchased. during the last
        three quarters of fiscal 2014, we saw strong and growing demand for gbb from
        both our customers and channel partners.also in early fiscal 2014, we introduced
        a utility pricing model that allows customers of amazon web services and other
        public cloud providers to rent ves by the hour or day, allowing them to deploy
        our products on a pay-as-they-go basis.f5 sales teams.\u00a0our inside sales
        team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage
        accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate
        resources. our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales
        regions: the americas (primarily the united states); europe, the middle east,
        and africa (emea); japan; and the asia pacific region (apac). field sales
        personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them, as necessary,
        in the sale of our products and services to their customers. we also sell
        our products and services directly to customers, primarily large enterprises,
        whose accounts are managed by our major account services team. field systems
        engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating
        in joint sales calls and providing pre-sale technical resources as needed.distributors
        and vars.\u00a0as a key component of our sales strategy, we have established
        relationships with a number of large national and international distributors,
        local and specialized distributors and vars. we derive a majority of our product
        sales from vars and rely on our large distributors primarily for fulfillment.our
        agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent
        them from selling competitive products. these agreements typically have terms
        of one year with no obligation to renew, and typically do not provide for
        exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements.for fiscal year
        2014, sales to three of our worldwide distributors, avnet technology solutions,
        ingram micro, inc. and westcon group, inc. represented 14.0%, 17.4% and 14.5%
        of our total revenues, respectively. our agreements with these distributors
        are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically
        on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 30\u00a0days
        written notice prior to the start of any renewal term. the agreements grant
        avnet technology solutions, ingram micro, inc. and westcon group, inc. the
        right to distribute our products to resellers in north america and certain
        other territories internationally, with no minimum purchase requirements.systems
        integrators.\u00a0we also market our products through strategic relationships
        with systems integrators, including dell services, hp enterprise services
        and ibm global services, who include our products as core components of application
        or network-based solutions they deploy for their customers. in most cases,
        systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their
        customers. instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader
        solutions, such as enterprise resource planning (erp) or customer relationship
        management (crm) solutions that incorporate our products for high availability
        and enhanced performance.resellers and technology partners. historically,
        our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through
        partnerships with large systems and software vendors. currently we partner
        with dell and hewlett-packard, who resell our products, and with other large
        technology companies, including microsoft, oracle, vmware and cisco, 12table
        of contentswho recommend our products to their customers. management of these
        relationships is the responsibility of our business development team, a component
        of our marketing organization, which closely monitors technology companies
        in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those
        whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our
        addressable market.marketingour marketing strategy is driven by the belief
        that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate
        the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions
        that meet those needs. in line with this belief, our marketing organization
        works directly with customers, partners and our product development teams
        to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership
        position.to support the growing number of developers using our products, including
        network and application architects, we continue to promote and expand devcentral,
        our on-line community website that provides technical resources to customers,
        prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize f5 solutions using irules
        and icall. a key aspect of devcentral is an on-line forum where developers
        as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions
        they have written with irules and icall. at the end of fiscal year 2014, devcentral
        had more than 165,000 registered members.we also engage in a number of marketing
        programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market
        awareness of our technology and products. these include actively participating
        in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology
        partners, and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on
        our latest products, business relationships and technology partnerships. in
        addition, we market our products to chief information officers and other information
        technology professionals through targeted advertising, direct mail and high-profile
        web events.backlogat the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we had product
        backlog of approximately $61.6 million and $57.9 million, respectively. backlog
        represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped
        generally within 90\u00a0days to customers with approved credit status. orders
        are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers or product specification
        changes by customers. although we believe that the backlog orders are firm,
        purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without
        significant penalty. for this reason, we believe that our product backlog
        at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.customer
        service and technical supportwe believe that our ability to provide consistent,
        high-quality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting
        and retaining large enterprise customers. accordingly, we offer a broad range
        of support services that include installation, phone support, hardware repair
        and replacement, software updates, online tools, consulting and training services.we
        provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multi-tiered
        support model, leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable.
        our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers
        to support our global customer base.prior to the installation of our products,
        our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs
        and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features
        and functions to meet those needs. our services personnel also provide on-site
        installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product
        features and functions.our customers typically purchase a one-year maintenance
        contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical
        support team. maintenance services provided under the contract include online
        updates, software error correction releases, hardware repair and replacement,
        and, in the majority of cases, round-the-clock call center support. free updates
        of our software are available to customers with a current maintenance contract.
        we also offer an online, automated, self-help customer support function called
        \u201cask f5\u201d that provides answers to many commonly asked questions,
        allowing customers to get information and solve problems quickly while significantly
        reducing the number of calls to our support desk. this enables us to provide
        comprehensive customer support while keeping our support-related expenses
        at a manageable, consistent level. we also offer an online service called
        ihealth, which allows customers to diagnose up-to-the-minute snapshots of
        their big-ip systems. diagnoses include tailored feedback about configuration
        issues or code defects, a description of the issue, recommendations for resolution,
        and a link to further information in the askf5\u2122 knowledge base.f5 offers
        training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products, including
        local and wide area network system administration and management. we have
        a complete certification program that qualifies our partners and customers
        for 13table of contentshaving the appropriate skills to implement and use
        the functionality of our products. to provide our customers with onsite and
        remote help, we have a professional services team able to provide a full range
        of fee-based consulting services, including comprehensive network management,
        documentation and performance analysis, and capacity planning to assist in
        predicting future network requirements. during fiscal year 2014 we increased
        the relative size or our professional services team in response to increasing
        customer demand.manufacturingwe outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured
        hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according
        to our specifications.our purpose-built systems are manufactured by flextronics
        international ltd. subcontracting activity at flextronics encompasses prototype
        builds, full production and direct fulfillment. flextronics also performs
        the following activities on our behalf; material procurement, pcb assembly
        and test, final assembly, system test, quality control, direct shipment and
        warranty repairs. we provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers
        to stock component parts and other materials, plan capacity and build finished
        goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand. flextronics procures components
        in volumes consistent with our forecast, assembles the products and tests
        them according to our specifications. products are then shipped to our distributors,
        value-added resellers, or end users. generally, we do not own the components.
        title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and
        then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location.
        if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified
        periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges
        for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products
        to meet our forecast or customer orders.hardware components for our products
        consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed
        and approved by our hardware engineering group. most of our components are
        purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers.
        however, some components used in the assembly of our products are purchased
        from a single or limited source.certain sub-assembly and testing processes
        of our products are performed at flextronics'' facility in zhuhai, china.
        the majority of our sub-assemblies are shipped to flextronics'' milpitas,
        california plant for configuration and final testing and eventual distribution
        to our end users. we also have capabilities to complete this process for some
        of our products in flextronics'' zhuhai, china plant for distribution to apac
        and japan end users.competitionthe expanding capabilities of our product offerings
        have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities, many of
        which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market
        as defined and measured by industry analysts such as gartner group, dell\u2019oro
        and others. in addition to server load-balancing, traffic management and other
        functions normally associated with application delivery, our suite of integrated
        product modules has expanded our addressable market into security, wan optimization,
        application acceleration, policy management, and diameter signaling and routing,
        where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional
        adc vendors. the ability to create custom network services using irules, icontrol
        and icall has also enabled us, our customers, and our partners to design solutions
        to problems for which there is no off-the-shelf solution. as a result, we
        believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of
        the features, functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent
        the addressable market for those products.within the more narrowly defined
        traditional adc market, several companies sell server load-balancing products.
        these include brocade communications systems, inc., citrix systems, inc. and
        a number of smaller competitors: radware ltd, a10 networks, array networks,
        inc., barracuda networks, inc., and riverbed technology.in related adc markets
        we compete with the following:\u2022cisco, juniper networks and checkpoint
        systems in the network firewall market;\u2022cisco, imperva and citrix in
        the web application firewall market;\u2022cisco, juniper and a10 in carrier
        grade nat;\u2022procera, allot, sandvine and other dpi vendors with our pem
        offerings;\u2022riverbed technology and silver peak systems in the wan optimization
        and application acceleration market; and\u2022oracle via the acquisition of

        networks in cloud-based ddos protection.\u2022blue coat systems in protecting
        enterprises from inbound and outbound malware.the principal competitive factors
        in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance,
        customer support, brand recognition, the scope of distribution and sales channels
        and pricing. certain of our competitors have employed and may in the future
        adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. however, because of
        the superior performance, broad functionality and unique capabilities of our
        products, which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and
        growing brand awareness, we believe that we can and will compete effectively
        against such pricing policies.intellectual propertywe rely on a combination
        of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on
        disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. we have obtained 216
        patents in the united states, 15\u00a0foreign patents and have applications
        pending for various aspects of our technology. our future success depends
        in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies
        used in our principal products. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
        rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or
        to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary.
        in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary
        rights as fully as do the laws of the united states. any issued patent may
        not preserve our proprietary position, and competitors or others may develop
        technologies similar to or superior to our technology. our failure to enforce
        and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating
        results and financial condition.in addition to our own proprietary software,
        we incorporate software licensed from several third-party sources into our
        products. these are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that
        generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers
        post termination. while we may not be able to renew certain of these licenses

        addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors
        should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business.our
        quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which
        may cause our stock price to fluctuateour quarterly and annual operating results
        have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the
        future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results.
        our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which
        are outside of our control, including the changing and recently volatile u.s.
        and global economic environment, which may cause our stock price to fluctuate.
        in particular, we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase
        as we continue to focus on larger business accounts. a delay in the recognition
        of revenue, even from just one account, may have a significant negative impact
        on our results of operations for a given period. in the past, a majority of
        our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter. accordingly, a delay
        in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively
        impact our results of operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that
        fiscal year. additionally, we have exposure to the credit risks of some of
        our customers and sub-tenants. although we have programs in place that are
        designed to monitor and 16table of contentsmitigate the associated risk, there
        can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit
        risks adequately. we monitor individual payment capability in granting credit
        arrangements, seek to limit the total credit to amounts we believe our customers
        can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for
        potential losses. if there is a deterioration of a sub-tenant\u2019s or a
        major customer\u2019s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than
        expected, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material
        adverse effect on our operating results. further, our operating results may
        be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters
        or years. our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market
        price of our common stock. such a decline could occur, and has occurred in
        the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenue and/or earnings
        guidance.our stock price could be volatile, particularly during times of economic
        uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock marketsour
        stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past.
        the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject
        to fluctuations in the future. some of the factors that could significantly
        affect the market price of our stock include:\u2022actual or anticipated variations
        in operating and financial results;\u2022analyst reports or recommendations;\u2022rumors,
        announcements or press articles regarding our competitors\u2019 operations,
        management, organization, financial condition or financial statements; and\u2022other
        events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.the stock market in
        general and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced
        extreme price and volume fluctuations. these fluctuations have often been
        unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance.  the fluctuations
        may continue in the future and this could significantly impact the value of
        our stock and your investment. cloud based computing trends present competitive
        and execution risks customers are transitioning to a hybrid computing environment
        utilizing various cloud-based software and services accessed via various smart
        client devices. pricing and delivery models are evolving and our competitors
        are developing and deploying cloud-based services for customers. we are devoting
        significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloud-based
        software and services strategies. while we believe our expertise and investments
        in software and infrastructure for cloud-based services provides us with a
        strong foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will
        attract the customers or generate the revenue required to be successful. in
        addition to software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and
        maintain infrastructure to support cloud-computing services. these costs may
        reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we are successful
        in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas,
        including:\u2022continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloud-based
        services that generate increasing traffic and market share;\u2022maintaining
        the utility, compatibility and performance of our software on the growing
        array of cloud computing platforms; and\u2022implementing the infrastructure
        to deliver our own cloud based services. these new business models may reduce
        our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect
        on our business, results of operations and financial condition.our business
        could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology
        marketa substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information
        technology by large enterprise customers and service providers. in addition
        to the challenges presented by new cloud computing models, we are dependent
        upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers
        and the continued growth and evolution of the internet. international, national,
        regional and local economic conditions, such as recessionary economic cycles,
        protracted economic slowdown or further deterioration of the economy could
        adversely impact demand for our products. demand for our products and services
        depends substantially upon the general demand for application delivery products
        and associated services, which fluctuates based on numerous factors, including
        capital spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers,
        as well as general economic conditions. moreover, the purchase of our products
        is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital
        and other resources. future economic projections for the information technology
        sector are uncertain as companies continue to reassess their spending for
        technology projects and embrace new models for delivery of it 17table of contentsservices,
        such as cloud computing. as a result, spending priorities for our current
        and future customers may vary and demand for our products and services may
        be impacted. in addition, customer buying patterns are changing over time
        and more customers seek to rent software on a subscription basis. these evolving
        business models could lead to changes in demand and licensing strategies,
        which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
        and financial condition.industry consolidation may result in increased competitionsome
        of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or
        other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than
        they had previously offered.\u00a0we have also entered into large, strategic
        partnerships to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace. as it
        companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the
        evolving application delivery, mobility, cloud networking and cloud platform
        markets, these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive it solutions
        to end users and combine enterprise-level hardware and software solutions
        that may compete with our solutions and which could negatively impact our
        partnerships.\u00a0these consolidators or potential consolidators may have
        significantly greater financial, technical and other resources than we do
        and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and
        services. the companies resulting from these possible combinations may create
        more compelling product and service offerings and be able to offer greater
        pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than
        we can.\u00a0these heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss
        of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates, all of\u00a0which
        could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.in
        addition to other risks listed in this \u201crisk factors\u201d section, factors
        that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to:\u2022fluctuations
        in demand for our products and services due to changing market conditions,
        pricing conditions, technology evolution, seasonality, or other changes in
        the global economic environment;\u2022changes or fluctuations in sales and
        implementation cycles for our products and services;\u2022reduced visibility
        into our customers\u2019 spending and implementation plans;\u2022reductions
        in customers\u2019 budgets for data center and other it purchases or delays
        in these purchases;\u2022fluctuations in our gross margins, including the
        factors described herein, which may contribute to such fluctuations;\u2022our
        ability to control costs, including operating expenses, the costs of hardware
        and software components, and other manufacturing costs;\u2022our ability to
        develop, introduce and gain market acceptance of new products, technologies
        and services, and our success in new and evolving markets;\u2022any significant
        changes in the competitive environment, including the entry of new competitors
        or the substantial discounting of products or services;\u2022the timing and
        execution of product transitions or new product introductions, and related
        inventory costs;\u2022variations in sales channels, product costs, or mix
        of products sold;\u2022our ability to establish and manage our distribution
        channels, and the effectiveness of any changes we make to our distribution
        model;\u2022the ability of our contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide
        component parts, hardware platforms and other products in a timely manner;\u2022benefits
        anticipated from our investments in sales, marketing, product development,
        manufacturing or other activities;\u2022changes in tax laws or regulations,
        or other accounting rules; and\u2022general economic conditions, both domestically
        and in our foreign markets.our success depends on our timely development of
        new products and features, market acceptance of new product offerings and
        proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our productsthe markets
        for our products and services are characterized by:\u2022rapid technological
        change;\u2022evolving industry standards;\u2022fluctuations in customer demand;18table
        of contents\u2022changes in customer requirements; and\u2022frequent new product
        and service introductions and enhancements.our continued success depends on
        our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our
        existing products to meet the demands of these changes, and the acceptance
        of those products and features by our existing and target customers. if we
        are unable to identify, develop and deploy new products and new product features
        on a timely basis, our business and results of operations may be harmed.the
        current development cycle for our products is on average 12-24\u00a0months.
        the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life
        cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products,
        thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction,
        and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation
        of the new products. this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales,
        increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater
        risk of product obsolescence. we have also experienced, and may in the future
        experience, delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements.
        this has led to, and may in the future lead to, delayed sales, increased expenses
        and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated. also, in the development of
        our products, we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products,
        which in turn has led to delays in product introductions. in addition, complexity
        and difficulties in managing product transitions at the end-of-life stage
        of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the
        outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses. any or all of the above
        problems could materially harm our business and results of operations.our
        success depends on sales and continued innovation of our application delivery
        networking product linesfor the fiscal year ended september\u00a030, 2014,
        we derived approximately 98.1% of our net product revenues, or approximately
        53.0% of our total net revenues, from sales of our application delivery networking
        (adn) product lines. we expect to continue to derive a significant portion
        of our net revenues from sales of our adn products in the future. implementation
        of our strategy depends upon these products being able to solve critical network
        availability, performance and security problems for our customers. if our
        adn products are unable to solve these problems for our customers or if we
        are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in our adn product feature
        set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive
        market environment, our business and results of operations will be harmed.we
        may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging application delivery
        networking marketthe markets we serve are new, rapidly evolving and highly
        competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future.
        our principal competitors in the application delivery networking market include
        brocade communications systems, inc., citrix systems, inc., radware ltd. and
        a10 networks. in related adc markets, we compete with the following:\u2022cisco,
        juniper networks and checkpoint systems in the network firewall market;\u2022cisco,
        imperva and citrix in the web application firewall market;\u2022cisco, juniper
        and a10 in carrier grade nat;\u2022procera, allot, sandvine and other dpi
        vendors with our pem offerings;\u2022riverbed technology and silver peak systems
        in the wan optimization and application acceleration market; and\u2022oracle
        via the acquisition of tekelec and acme packet in the diameter signaling market.\u2022ibm
        in end-user protection against malware, phishing and other cyberthreats.\u2022akamai
        networks in cloud-based ddos protection.\u2022blue coat systems in protecting
        enterprises from inbound and outbound malware.we expect to continue to face
        additional competition as new participants enter our markets. as we continue
        to expand globally, we may see new competitors in different geographic regions.
        in addition, larger companies with significant resources, brand recognition,
        and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing application
        delivery networking solutions from other companies and emerge as significant
        competitors. potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate
        an internet traffic management or security component into existing products
        in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. any of these
        circumstances may limit our opportunities for growth and negatively impact
        our financial performance.19table of contentsthe average selling price of
        our products may decrease and our costs may increase, which may negatively
        impact gross profitsit is possible that the average selling prices of our
        products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures,
        increased sales discounts, new product introductions by us or our competitors
        or other factors. therefore, in order to maintain our gross profits, we must
        develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis
        and continually reduce our product costs. our failure to do so will cause
        our net revenue and gross profits to decline, which will harm our business
        and results of operations. in addition, we may experience substantial period-to-period
        fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average
        selling prices.it is difficult to predict our future operating results because
        we have an unpredictable sales cycleour products have a lengthy sales cycle
        and the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict. historically, our sales
        cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to
        lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise
        market. also, as our distribution strategy is focused on a channel model,
        utilizing value-added resellers, distributors and systems integrators, the
        level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has
        increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our
        sales transactions. sales of our products require us to educate potential
        customers in their use and benefits. sales of our products are subject to
        delays from the lengthy internal budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation
        processes that large enterprises and governmental entities may require. for
        example, customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited
        basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide
        whether or not to purchase. customers may also defer orders as a result of
        anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or
        us. as a result, our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes
        to the uncertainty of our future operating results.our business may be harmed
        if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies
        of our products or if a single source of hardware assembly is lost or impairedwe
        outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to third party contract
        manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications.
        we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers
        in the past. however, if we experience major delays in the future or other
        problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product, any
        one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of
        operations. the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with
        adequate supplies of our products or the loss of one or more of our contract
        manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we
        obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of
        operations. in particular, we currently subcontract manufacturing of our application
        delivery networking products to a single contract manufacturer with whom we
        do not have a long-term contract. if our arrangement with this single source
        of hardware assembly was terminated or otherwise impaired, and we were not
        able to engage another contract manufacturer in a timely manner, our business,
        financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.if
        the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase our raw material
        and component purchases, contract manufacturing capacity and internal test
        and quality control functions. any disruptions in product flow may limit our
        revenue, may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs
        or cancellation of orders by our customers.our business could suffer if there
        are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from
        our third-party sourceswe currently purchase several hardware components used
        in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources.
        lead times for these components vary significantly. the unavailability of
        suitable components, any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these
        hardware components or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate
        sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, may delay assembly
        and sales of our products and, hence, our revenues, and may harm our business
        and results of operations.we are subject to governmental export and import
        controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete
        in international marketsour products are subject to u.s.\u00a0export controls
        and may be exported outside the u.s.\u00a0only with the required level of
        export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate
        encryption technology into our products. in addition, various countries regulate
        the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could
        limit our ability to distribute our products or our customers\u2019 ability
        to implement our products in those countries. changes in our products or changes
        in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of
        our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international
        operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or,
        in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries
        altogether. any change in export or import 20table of contentsregulations
        or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing
        regulations or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by
        such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in
        our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential
        customers with international operations. any decreased use of our products
        or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely
        affect our business, operating results and financial condition.reliance on
        shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable
        period to fall below expected levelsas a result of customer buying patterns
        and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed
        their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion
        of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the
        last few weeks of each fiscal quarter. in addition, any significant interruption
        in our information technology systems, which manage critical functions such
        as order processing, revenue recognition, financial forecasts, inventory and
        supply chain management, and trade compliance reviews, could result in delayed
        order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that fiscal quarter. if expected
        revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason, including
        the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize, our third party
        contract manufacturers\u2019 inability to manufacture and ship products prior
        to fiscal quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of
        the fiscal quarter, our failure to manage inventory to meet demand, our inability
        to release new products on schedule, any failure of our systems related to
        order review and processing, or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance
        requirements, our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations,
        resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.we may not
        be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and our products
        may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third partieswe rely on
        a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and restrictions
        on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual
        property rights. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized
        parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology.
        monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be
        certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our
        technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect
        our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states.our industry is characterized
        by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related
        litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. in the
        ordinary course of our business, we are involved in disputes and licensing
        discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot
        provide assurance that we will always successfully defend ourselves against
        such claims. we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number
        of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur. also,
        as we have gained greater visibility, market exposure and competitive success,
        we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement
        claims. if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, or if
        we otherwise settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties
        and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter
        our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights.
        any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all.
        similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the
        rights of others may be costly or impractical. in addition, we have initiated,
        and may in the future initiate, claims or litigation against third parties
        for infringement of our proprietary rights, or to determine the scope and
        validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors. any of these
        claims, whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others,
        or vice versa, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly
        litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require
        us to cease using infringing technology, develop non-infringing technology
        or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. further, our license agreements
        typically require us to indemnify our customers, distributors and resellers
        for infringement actions related to our technology, which could cause us to
        become involved in infringement claims made against our customers, distributors
        or resellers. any of the above-described circumstances relating to intellectual
        property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations
        being harmed.we incorporate open source software into our products. although
        we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open source licenses
        have not been interpreted by u.s. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses
        could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions
        or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. we could also
        be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes
        in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products.
        in either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties
        in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or
        to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot
        be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely
        affect our business, operating results and financial condition.21table of
        contentsmany of our products include intellectual property licensed from third
        parties. in the future, it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party
        intellectual property or obtain new licenses for other technology. these third
        party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.
        the inability to obtain certain licenses, or litigation regarding the interpretation
        or enforcement of license rights and related intellectual property issues,
        could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
        financial condition. furthermore, we license some third party intellectual
        property on a non-exclusive basis and this may limit our ability to protect
        our intellectual property rights in our products.we may not be able to sustain
        or develop new distribution relationships, and a reduction or delay in sales
        to significant distribution partners could hurt our businesswe sell our products
        and services through multiple distribution channels in the united states and
        internationally, including leading industry distributors, value-added resellers,
        systems integrators, service providers and other indirect channel partners.
        we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels, and
        we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or
        maintain our existing relationships. recruiting and retaining qualified channel
        partners and training them in our technologies requires significant time and
        resources. these channel partners may also market, sell and support products
        and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources
        to the marketing, sales and support of such competitive products. our indirect
        sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability,
        and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresent
        the functionality of our products or services to customers or violate laws
        or our corporate policies. if we are unable to establish or maintain our indirect
        sales channels, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in
        addition, three worldwide distributors of our products accounted for 45.9%
        of our total net revenue for fiscal year 2014. three worldwide distributors
        of our products accounted for 44.1% of our total net revenue for fiscal year
        2013. a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to these distribution
        partners, if not replaced by sales to other indirect channel partners and
        distributors, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.undetected
        software or hardware errors or security vulnerabilities may harm our business
        and results of operationsour products may contain undetected errors or defects
        when first introduced or as new versions are released. we have experienced
        these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product
        upgrades. we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to
        time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments.
        these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs,
        divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development
        efforts and cause significant customer relations problems. we may also be
        subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects.
        while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability, these policies
        may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted. a material
        product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations.our
        products must successfully operate with products from other vendors. as a
        result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify
        the source of the problem. the occurrence of software or hardware problems,
        whether caused by our products or another vendor\u2019s products, may result
        in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. the occurrence
        of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations.our
        products are used to manage critical applications and data for customers and
        third parties may attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities in our products.
        as we continue to focus on the development and marketing of security solutions,
        we become a bigger target for malicious computer hackers who wish to exploit
        security vulnerabilities in our products. these problems may cause us to incur
        significant remediation costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel
        from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations
        problems. adverse publicity related to security vulnerabilities or damage
        to a customer\u2019s operations due to exploitation of security vulnerability
        in our products may harm our business and results of operations.any errors,
        defects or vulnerabilities in our products could result in:\u2022expenditures
        of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze,
        correct, eliminate, or work-around errors and defects or to address and eliminate
        vulnerabilities;\u2022loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners;\u2022delayed
        or lost revenue;\u2022delay or failure to attain market acceptance;\u2022an
        increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or an
        increased cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely
        affect our gross margins; and22table of contents\u2022litigation, regulatory
        inquiries, or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation.we
        are dependent on various information technology systems, and failures of or
        interruptions to those systems could harm our businessmany of our business
        processes depend upon our it systems, the systems and processes of third parties,
        and on interfaces with the systems of third parties. for example, our order
        entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers,
        which enables them to build and ship our products. if those systems fail or
        are interrupted, or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more
        networks is interrupted, our processes may function at a diminished level
        or not at all. this would harm our ability to ship products, and our financial
        results may be harmed.in addition, reconfiguring our it systems or other business
        processes in response to changing business needs may be time-consuming and
        costly. to the extent this impacted our ability to react timely to specific
        market or business opportunities, our financial results may be harmed.our
        operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerceas
        our international sales increase, our operating results become more exposed
        to international operating risks. additionally, our international sales and
        operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\u2022greater
        difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer
        collection periods;\u2022the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property
        rights in some countries;\u2022greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory
        practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties;\u2022risks associated with
        trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including the importation,
        certification, and localization of our products required in foreign countries;\u2022greater
        risk of a failure of foreign employees, partners, distributors, and resellers
        to comply with both u.s. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations,
        the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and any trade regulations ensuring
        fair trade practices;\u2022heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices
        in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that
        may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities
        in, financial statements;\u2022increased expenses incurred in establishing
        and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;\u2022greater
        difficulty in recruiting local experienced personnel, and the costs and expenses
        associated with such activities;\u2022management communication and integration
        problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;\u2022fluctuations
        in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in markets
        where we do business;\u2022economic uncertainty around the world, including
        continued economic uncertainty as a result of sovereign debt issues in europe;
        and\u2022general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets.we
        must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign
        operations. to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting, training,
        managing, and retaining an international staff, and specifically staff related
        to sales management and sales personnel, we may experience difficulties in
        sales productivity in foreign markets. we also enter into strategic distributor
        and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets
        where we do not have a local presence. if we are not able to maintain successful
        strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional
        companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships, our future success
        in these international markets could be limited. business practices in the
        international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states
        and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard
        terms in customer contracts. we intend to continue expanding into international
        markets. sales outside of the americas represented 43.1% and 42.5% of our
        net revenues for the fiscal years ended september\u00a030, 2014 and 2013,
        respectively.these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain
        future international revenues and, consequently, materially impact our business,
        operating results, and financial condition. the expansion of our existing
        international operations and entry into additional international markets will
        require significant management attention and financial resources. our failure
        to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks
        effectively could limit the future growth of our business.23table of contentsa
        portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which
        are subject to a number of challenges and riskssales to u.s. and foreign,
        federal, state, and local governmental agency end-customers account for a
        significant portion of our revenues and we may in the future increase sales
        to government entities. sales to government entities are subject to a number
        of risks. selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive,
        and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without
        any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. the substantial majority
        of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through
        our channel partners. government certification requirements for products like
        ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal
        government sector until we have attained the revised certification. government
        demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public
        sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions
        or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services.
        government entities may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights
        to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience
        or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future
        operating results. governments routinely investigate and audit government
        contractors\u2019 administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could
        result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services,
        a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit
        uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could adversely impact our
        operating results in a material way. finally, for purchases by the u.s. government,
        the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united
        states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations, and we may
        not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the
        u.s. government, affecting our ability to sell these products to the u.s.
        government.our failure to adequately protect personal information could have
        a material adverse effect on our businessa wide variety of  local, state,
        national, and international laws, directives and regulations apply to the
        collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing
        of personal data. these data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations
        continue to evolve and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public
        scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased
        costs of compliance. our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations,
        or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action against us, including
        fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages
        by end-customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation
        and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing end-customers and prospective
        end-customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations,
        financial performance, and business. changing definitions of personal data
        and personal information, within the european union, the united states, and
        elsewhere, especially relating to classification of ip addresses, machine
        identification, location data, and other information, may limit or inhibit
        our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic
        partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. misuse of our products
        could harm our reputationour products may be misused by end-customers or third
        parties that obtain access to our products. for example, our products could
        be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet. such
        use of our products for censorship could result in negative publicity and
        damage to our reputation.  in addition, as many of our products are subject
        to export control regulations, diversion of our products to restricted third
        parties by others could result in investigations, penalties, fines, trade
        restrictions and  negative publicity that could damage our reputation and
        materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.changes
        in governmental regulations could negatively affect our revenuesmany of our
        products are subject to various regulations promulgated by the united states
        and various foreign governments including, but not limited to, environmental
        regulations and regulations implementing export license requirements and restrictions
        on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology.
        changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain
        required approvals, permits or registrations could harm our international
        and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues, business and operations.new
        regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional
        expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals
        and minerals used in the manufacturing of our productsin august 2012, the
        sec adopted new requirements under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer
        protection act of 2010 (or the dodd-frank act) for companies that use certain
        minerals and derivative metals (referred to as conflict minerals, regardless
        of their country of origin) in their products, whether or not these products
        are manufactured by third parties. the dodd-frank act requires companies to
        perform due diligence and disclose whether or not such minerals originate
        from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries.\u00a0we filed
        a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 30, 2014 and
        are required to file on an annual basis going forward. these new requirements
        could adversely 24table of contentsaffect the sourcing, availability and pricing
        of minerals or metals used in the manufacture of our products and the numerous
        components that go into our products all of which could adversely affect our
        business, financial condition, and operating results.\u00a0in addition, we
        will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including
        costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals
        used in our products. we have a complex supply chain and many components are
        sourced through our contract manufacturer and we may not be able to sufficiently
        verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through
        the due diligence procedures that we implement. as a result, we may face reputational
        challenges with our customers and other stakeholders and possible regulatory
        risk.changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected
        revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operationsa change
        in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results
        and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change
        is effective. new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements
        have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future. changes to existing
        rules, or changes to the interpretations of existing rules, could lead to
        changes in our accounting practices, and such changes could adversely affect
        our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.we may have
        exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilitiesour provision for income
        taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible
        stock-based compensation, changes in the research and development tax credit
        laws, earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have
        lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where
        we have higher statutory rates, transfer pricing adjustments, not meeting
        the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives, changes in the valuation
        of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in actual results versus
        our estimates, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles
        or interpretations thereof. in addition, like other companies, we may be subject
        to examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service
        and other tax authorities. while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
        outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income
        taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that
        a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our
        results of operations.acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize
        the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the
        transactionwith respect to our past acquisitions, as well as any other future
        acquisitions we may undertake, we may find that the acquired businesses, products
        or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected, that we
        paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions
        change, all of which may generate future impairment charges. our acquisitions
        may be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. there
        may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired
        business, and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired
        business. we may have difficulty in integrating the acquired technologies
        or products with our existing product lines. our ongoing business and management\u2019s

        and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations.
        we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures

        to successfully operate and integrate newly-acquired businesses appropriately,
        effectively and in a timely manner, or to retain key personnel of any acquired
        business, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage
        of further growth in demand for integrated traffic management and security
        solutions and other advances in technology, as well as on our revenues, gross
        margins and expenses.our success depends on our key personnel and our ability
        to hire, retain and motivate qualified executives, sales and marketing, operations,
        product development and professional services personnelour success depends,
        in large part, on our ability to attract, engage, retain, and integrate qualified
        executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. in
        order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive
        marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including
        cash- and equity-based compensation. if we do not obtain the stockholder approval
        needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner, our
        ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could
        be weakened. failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or
        the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact
        on our operations. in addition, our ceo recently announced his intended retirement
        at the end of fiscal year 2015. the process of identifying his successor could
        be disruptive to our business and the failure to identify and hire his successor
        in a timely manner could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
        further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business,
        and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees
        could adversely 25table of contentsaffect our business and results of operations.
        the complexity of our application delivery networking products and their integration
        into existing networks and ongoing support, as well as the sophistication
        of our sales and marketing effort, requires us to retain highly trained developers,
        professional services, customer support and sales personnel. competition for
        qualified developers, professional services, customer support and sales personnel
        in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available
        with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products. our
        ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility
        or reductions in the price of our common stock, since these employees are
        generally granted restricted stock units. the loss of services of any of our
        key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in
        the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel may harm our business and
        results of operations.we face litigation riskswe are a party to lawsuits in
        the normal course of our business. litigation in general, and intellectual
        property and securities litigation in particular, can be expensive, lengthy
        and disruptive to normal business operations. moreover, the results of complex
        legal proceedings are difficult to predict. responding to lawsuits has been,
        and will likely continue to be, expensive and time-consuming for us. an unfavorable
        resolution of these lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results
        of operations or financial condition.anti-takeover provisions could make it
        more difficult for a third party to acquire usour board of directors has the

        voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders.
        the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely
        affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be
        issued in the future. the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect
        of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without
        further action by our shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and
        other rights of the holders of common stock. further, certain provisions of
        our bylaws, including a provision limiting the ability of shareholders to
        raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice,
        may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management
        of our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of
        our common stock. in addition, our articles of incorporation currently provide
        for a staggered board, which may make it more difficult for a third party
        to gain control of our board of directors. similarly, state anti-takeover
        laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent
        or delay a change of control of our company.our business is subject to the

        events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorisma significant
        natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a fire, a flood, or a significant
        power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating
        results, and financial condition. we have an administrative and product development
        office and a third party contract manufacturer located in the san francisco
        bay area, a region known for seismic activity. in addition, natural disasters
        could affect our supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers\u2019

        or assisting with shipments on a timely basis. in the event our or our service
        providers\u2019 information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics
        abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could
        be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment
        targets, for a particular quarter. in addition, cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism,
        or other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the
        business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners,
        or end-customers or the economy as a whole. any disruption in the business
        of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end-customers

        adverse impact on our quarterly results. all of the aforementioned risks may
        be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers
        prove to be inadequate. to the extent that any of the above should result

        global media measurement and information company serving the entertainment,
        television, video and advertising industries.  our software as a service (\u201csaas\u201d)
        technology merges census-based television viewership information from over
        100 million tvs and devices with consumer behavior and purchase information
        (\u201cadvanced demographics\u201d) across multiple platforms, devices and
        distribution channels.  we also measure box office results from more than
        100,000 movie screens in 36 countries throughout the world.  we process and
        aggregate hundreds of billions of data transactions from multiple screens
        wherever entertainment content is viewed, whether at the box office, on a
        television screen, over the internet, on a smart phone or other portable device.  rentrak
        measures live tv, recorded tv (\u201cdvr\u201d), video-on-demand (\u201cvod\u201d),
        and whether  the content is free, purchased, rented, recorded, downloaded
        or streamed from multiple channels.  these massive content databases provide
        stable and granular viewership information across every screen (\u201cmultiscreen\u201d)
        and are anonymously matched with third-party consumer segmentation and purchase
        databases using privacy compliant methodologies.  by linking multiscreen viewership
        information with information about the products viewers consume and prefer,
        we provide our clients, such as content producers, distributors, advertisers
        and advertising agencies, with the knowledge necessary to more effectively
        manage their businesses, program and market their networks and more precisely
        target and sell their advertising inventory.  the benefits to the advertising
        community are improvements in profitability while effectively targeting specific
        tv shows against the demographics of the products viewers buy, the cars they
        drive and how they are likely to vote in elections.  the benefits to the movie
        industry and video (tv) content owners are they can manage their businesses
        in real time or near real time and also improve their profitability.  additionally,
        certain clients use our databases to populate programmatic buying systems.  these
        systems automate the buying process and introduce efficiencies for both advertising
        agencies and their clients.rentrak corporation is an oregon corporation and
        was incorporated in 1977, and is headquartered in portland, oregon, with additional
        offices in the united states and around the world. previously, we had two
        operating divisions within our corporate structure and we reported certain
        financial information by individual segment under this structure.  those two
        operating divisions were our advanced media and information (\u201cami\u201d)
        operating division, which included our media measurement services, and our
        home entertainment operating division, which included our distribution services
        as well as services that measure, aggregate and report consumer rental activity
        on film product from traditional \u201cbrick and mortar,\u201d online and
        kiosk retailers.  during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march
        31, 2014 (\u201cfiscal 2014\u201d), we initiated our plan to sell our pay
        per transaction\u00ae\u00a0(\u201cppt\u00ae\u201d)\u00a0business, which has
        been a longstanding legacy business of rentrak and a significant component
        of the home entertainment operating division.  the ppt\u00ae business represented
        42.5%, 48.3% and 58.4% of our total revenue for our fiscal years ended march
        31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.  for fiscal 2014, it would have represented 37.4%
        of our total revenue if we had decided to retain the line.  our ppt\u00ae
        business has been in a state of decline due to the decline of physical dvd
        rentals from retail stores.  this strategic decision to sell ppt\u00ae will
        enable us to focus more fully on the growth of our media measurement business
        and advanced consumer targeting business.  accordingly, we have restated our
        financial results and the ppt\u00ae\u00a0business is reported as discontinued
        operations for all periods presented. as a result of our plan to divest our
        ppt\u00ae business, we will operate in a single business segment encompassing
        our media measurement services which are primarily delivered through scalable,
        saas products within our entertainment essentials\u2122 lines of business.  these
        syndicated big data services, offered primarily on a recurring subscription
        basis, provide consumer viewership information integrated with consumer segmentation
        and purchase behavior databases.  we provide film studios, television networks
        and local stations, cable, satellite and telecommunications company (\u201ctelco\u201d)
        operators, advertisers and advertising agencies unique insights into consumer
        viewing and purchasing patterns through our comprehensive and expansive information
        on local, national, vod and \u201cover the top\u201d television performance
        and worldwide box office results.  our movie measurement business is a global
        business measuring more than 90% of the ticket sales globally in real or near
        real time, allowing for decisions to be made to market, promote and manage
        the industry for maximum profitability.3our products and services  our media
        measurement services are distributed to clients through patent pending software
        systems and business processes into two broad areas within the entertainment
        industry, which we refer to as movies everywhere\u2122 and tv everywhere\u2122.  we
        refer to our approach as the \u201ccensus-based (or census-like) currency.\u201d  the
        results for tv everywhere\u2122 are from nearly every zip code in america,
        projected to all 210 local tv markets and to a national level across multiple
        distribution platforms.  this method results in granular levels of processing
        from billions of transactions and establishes us as the only company that
        provides a television ratings census-like currency with advanced demographics
        (the products we buy and the \u201clifestyles\u201d we lead).  we are the
        only source of worldwide movie box office results, trends and insights.  our
        business growth of movies everywhere\u2122 is due to our continued expansion
        of our global footprint, as well as the introduction of new products to help
        studios and content creators better monetize their content for maximum profitability.  we
        also believe there is significant opportunity for continued growth within
        our tv everywhere\u2122 service offerings.  as the tv, video and advertising
        sectors continue to evolve, they are becoming increasingly more fragmented,
        and consumers can view a wide variety of entertainment content wherever and
        whenever they choose via an expanding array of devices and technologies.  we
        have invested heavily in our systems, processes and databases in order to
        address the evolving needs of the industry and help our clients maximize the
        efficiency and effectiveness of their advertising programs.  our systems capture
        total television audience information by providing the largest coverage from
        multiple screens and providers and merge that information with advanced demographics
        and information relating to actual consumer purchase behavior.  we are the
        only company who can offer a census-like currency to our clients.  \u00a0\u00a0our
        services are designed to help our clients understand consumer viewing, reaction
        and purchase behavior everywhere content and advertising are consumed to allow
        both sellers and buyers to more precisely target the most relevant viewing
        audience.  this precise targeting enables our clients to optimize their marketing,
        sales and advertising strategies.  the majority of our service offerings are
        related to four major types of content:  1) ad supported content, specifically
        linear television which can be viewed as a scheduled program, in a time-shifted
        manner, on vod, streamed or downloaded from the internet or via a mobile device,  2)
        subscription- or transactional-based programming content, 3) advanced media
        and analytics, which provides audience targets, measurement and marketing
        mix optimization for television and digital viewing content combined and 4)
        theatrical box office content.  typical customers utilizing our services include
        content producers, studios, distributors, national networks, local stations,
        satellite and cable operators, agencies, and a wide spectrum of advertisers,
        ranging from traditional consumer brands to various political groups.  we
        also provide many of our clients tailored research and analytical solutions
        unique to their needs and specifications.  our most significant lines of business,
        which we refer to as entertainment essentials\u2122 services, are: \u2022tv
        everywhere\u2122, which includes tv essentials\u00ae and stationview essentials\u2122;\u2022ondemand
        everywhere\u00ae, which includes ondemand essentials\u00ae, over the top measurement
        products and related products; \u2022movies everywhere\u2122, which includes
        domestic and international box office essentials\u00ae, posttrak\u00ae and
        preact\u2122; and\u2022other services, which includes our studio direct revenue
        sharing (\u201cdrs\u201d) and other products relating to content in the home
        video rental industry.in august 2013, we acquired itvx, a provider of branded
        entertainment analytics, insight and research.  going beyond traditional product
        placement, branded entertainment is the creation and integration of original
        branded content into television, movie and other digital entertainment content
        types.  successful branded entertainment spurs consumers to engage and interact
        with a brand through the strategic placement of marketing messages across
        every screen.  our branded entertainment services provide our clients with
        the impact brand integration has on consumers across movie and television
        content on all screens, which enables users to assess the total media value
        of their campaigns.  the financial results of itvx from the date of acquisition
        are included within our tv everywhere\u2122 line of business. our revenue
        increased $18.6 million, or 32.6%, in fiscal 2014 compared to the fiscal year
        ended march\u00a031, 2013 (\u201cfiscal 2013\u201d). our current spending,
        investments and long-term strategic planning are heavily focused on the innovation,
        development, growth and expansion of our services and product lines, both
        domestically and internationally.  as such, we continue to allocate significant
        resources towards innovation and the expansion of our data assets and technology
        as well as our research, analytics and sales groups.  these strategic investments,
        many of which are expensed as incurred, have lowered our overall operating
        performance and, as a result, we had operating losses from continuing operations
        of $9.5 million and $26.5 million for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.  4tv
        everywhere\u2122\u00a0we provide our customers with second-by-second performance
        metrics that deliver consumer viewing behavior for scheduled, interactive,
        and digital video recorder (\u201cdvr\u201d) television content.  we aggregate
        transaction-level data across all 210 designated local television markets
        in the united states, which are projected to the complete footprint of  television
        households resulting in massive amounts of viewing behavior from every market.  we
        currently have multi-year contracts with a number of data providers including
        dish network l.l.c. (\u201cdish\u201d), at&t services, inc. (\u201cat&t),
        charter communications, inc., and fourthwall media, inc. and will soon be
        integrating data from directv llc and cox communications, inc. (\u201ccox\u201d),
        expanding our measurement footprint even further.  our viewership information,
        which integrates satellite, telco, cable and projects over the air viewing,
        provides our customers with a deep level of granularity and stability, and
        thus the competitive advantage of a more informed understanding of the viewing
        audience.  we provide our customers with access to information from hundreds
        of networks, which is more than twice as much available elsewhere.  our technology
        includes web-based reporting systems, which provide clients with instant access
        to the measurement metrics and detailed analytics key to tracking content
        and consumer behavior across multiple platforms and devices.  we also provide
        advanced demographics, which allow our customers to more accurately pinpoint
        audiences they want to reach, by combining our massive viewership information
        with third party consumer behavior information from a variety of industry-leading
        sources, enabling our customers to develop more targeted approaches to ad
        selling and buying.  as an example of our census-like currency, our roster
        of political advertisers continues to quickly expand because we help candidates
        target the audiences they want to reach and more efficiently and effectively
        utilize their campaign funds.  our most significant products for measurement
        of national and local television audiences within our tv everywhere\u2122
        services include tv essentials\u00ae and stationview essentials\u2122.  tv
        essentials\u00ae is a comprehensive suite of research and analytical tools
        that reports network television audience viewership patterns across all facets
        of television programming and advertising, including linear and dvr television
        viewing.  by providing transaction-level performance metrics from millions
        of televisions across the united states, tv essentials\u00ae helps our national
        network, agency and advertiser clients make better decisions by giving them
        a greater and more relevant and reliable understanding of the true value of
        their viewing audiences.  we provide insight into programming effectiveness,
        enabling networks and network operators to optimize their tv advertising inventory.  developed
        with the potential capacity to handle data from all of the nation\u2019s television
        households, the system can isolate individual market, network, series or telecast
        performances, administer national and local estimates and provide an evaluation
        of influencing factors such as purchase behaviors and advanced demographics
        for competitive, in-depth intelligence.  one of the biggest advantages of
        tv essentials\u00ae is that it combines the stability and granularity of tv
        viewing information with marketing segmentation and advertiser databases,
        resulting in robust targeted tv viewership intelligence.  our advanced television
        targeting enables our customers to spend their advertising dollars more efficiently
        and effectively since they are able to target consumers who they believe will
        purchase their products.  in addition, with tv essentials\u00ae exact commercial
        ratings\u00ae,  we are able to provide our national clients with the ability
        to determine the performance of a specific commercial on their network campaigns
        so they can plan, buy and sell advertising more strategically.stationview
        essentials\u2122 is a local market television measurement and analytical service
        specifically designed to meet the unique needs of local television station
        and cable sales, news and management teams, as well as local agency media
        directors, planners and buyers.  stationview essentials\u2122 allows clients
        to better understand consumer viewing patterns across local tv stations and
        cable channels in their market(s), monitor and maximize daily program performance
        by evaluating viewing trends down to the minute, and identify how similar
        audiences view programming across multiple stations and local cable channels
        to (a) more efficiently and effectively promote viewership to a particular
        station and (b) negotiate inventory pricing.  with our stable and reliable
        ratings information and our highly targeted advanced demographics, clients
        can isolate and reach the customers most likely to purchase a given product
        and sell or buy their advertising far more effectively and profitably.  our
        local market services provide insights which stations and agencies can use
        to accurately pinpoint the audiences they want to reach, which increases the
        value of the inventory and, ultimately, enables our customers to either sell
        their inventory for a higher price or buy their schedules more effectively,
        thereby increasing the advertisers\u2019 sales volume.technology has evolved
        in terms of how television advertising is bought and sold.  systems have been
        developed to automate the tv ad buying and selling processes, which is referred
        to as programmatic buying/selling for television advertising (\u201cprogrammatic
        tv\u201d).  programmatic tv is different from current sales methods because
        it enables sellers and buyers to use computer software to automatically sell/buy
        inventory based on the relevance of the audience and efficiency of the pricing.  with
        our advanced demographics and granular census currency, used by several companies
        utilizing programmatic tv systems, we can help our clients target their desired
        audiences far more effectively.  for example, local cable and satellite providers
        are embracing programmatic tv because the technology allows them to use audience
        viewing information to more effectively understand the type of people who
        are watching their ads.  our services would show our clients that viewers
        of a particular network at a particular time are more likely to be in the
        market for a particular product.  this knowledge enables them to increase
        the value of their 5advertising inventory and increase the likelihood that
        specific targeted audiences are exposed to specific ads, thereby adding to
        our client\u2019s profitability.ondemand everywhere\u00ae\u00a0the vod market
        continues to evolve and change and the amount of time spent with on demand
        broadcast prime-time content increased by 24% in calendar 2013.  innovation
        and technological advances continue to provide improved viewer experiences
        across a growing number of distribution platforms.  consumers are demonstrating
        increased control over what entertainment content they watch, when they watch
        it and on what device, whether from a television, on a dvr, on vod, or from
        a wide variety of over the top (\u201cott\u201d) platforms, such as netflix,
        hulu, vudu and itunes, and tv everywhere\u2122 platforms such as xfinity,
        fios, and at&t u-verse, which continues to increase the breadth of entertainment
        content available to the consumer.  another significant shift continues to
        occur as consumers move away from paid vod content to what is known as \u201cfree
        on demand,\u201d or ad supported, content.  currently, more than 78% of all
        vod content viewed is free on demand and over half of the viewing happens
        after the seventh day that it is aired.  these trends are also changing the
        way tv operators perceive the advertising opportunity, how advertisers look
        at viewership information and how content providers monetize their content.  we
        are uniquely positioned as the only company with full census measurement of
        vod.  we currently collect 100% of all vod television viewing data in the
        united states from more than 110 million television sets and report information
        relating to how consumers interact with this content.   our information includes
        vod, broadband, video and mobile device content transactions, and we currently
        receive our data from all multi-system operators, including comcast corp,
        time warner cable, inc., at&t, cox and charter communications, inc., as well
        as network-owned sites and apps, mobile content providers such as at&t, cox,
        t-mobile and mobi.tv, itunes, xbox, vudu, playstation, google and amazon.  our
        ondemand everywhere\u00ae products include ondemand essentials\u00ae, adessentials\u00ae,
        internet tv essentials\u00ae, digital download essentials\u00ae, vod monitor\u2122
        and mobile ondemand essentials\u2122.  the most significant service is ondemand
        essentials\u00ae.   ondemand essentials\u00ae (\u201code\u201d) provides multichannel
        video programming distributors (\u201cmvpds\u201d) and content providers (including
        broadcast/cable networks and studios) with a transactional tracking and reporting
        system to view and analyze the performance of vod content.  this web-based
        system provides clients throughout the united states, canada and spain with
        access to the tools needed to track on demand content, trends and consumer
        behavior and represents information from over 110 million televisions from
        every operator that offers vod programming.  our system includes daily, census-level
        data of current and historical market- and title-level content performance
        from 43 mvpds.  rentrak is the planning currency for vod advertising today.  our
        other services within ondemand everywhere\u00ae currently include the measurement
        of vod advertising across our national footprint of operators as well as tracking
        and reporting on the availability of vod content.  we also provide an auditing
        service which contains performance intelligence on purchased and rented movie
        and television content downloaded or streamed via the internet, including
        royalty report tracking.  additionally, our systems process online usage data
        to help clients manage their ad-supported and subscription-based television
        programming content streamed online. there are also some significant advances
        in the industry relating to television advertising technology which will allow
        our clients to better monetize their content and capture more of the growing
        number of people who watch television on a time-shifted basis, often days
        or weeks after a show airs.  this newer technology, dynamic ad insertion (\u201cdai\u201d),
        enables tv networks to switch out and replace ads on programs that air on
        vod in as little as 24 hours, instead of having to wait weeks which has been
        the case previously.  dai will make it much easier for networks to remove
        ads that can become stale or irrelevant after a few days, thus making vod
        a more attractive medium for advertisers.  vod content providers will be able
        to use our ondemand essentials\u00ae systems to better understand viewership,
        make more informed advertising decisions using our advanced demographics and
        more precisely target the right consumers at the right time.  dynamic advertising
        represents a great opportunity for growth for rentrak as we expand our services
        to include ad measurement in addition to content measurement.our arrangements
        with our clients and the information we provide them are also changing and
        expanding.  historically, our content providers could only access information
        relating to how their own content performed across all mvpds.  they were not
        able to see the performance of the content of other providers.  now, we are
        able to show how a title performs compared to all other titles.  we believe
        our title-level transparency capabilities, which extend across many networks,
        including all our major networks, will create value for our clients and will
        enable us to expand our product offerings relating to vod advertising and
        content performance.  we are also working on initiatives to apply the same
        advanced demographics to vod as we have in our tv essentials\u00ae service,
        which will help our clients understand the quality of the vod audience and
        not just the size.   6we are currently beta testing a new service, multiscreen
        essentials\u2122, which expands the capability of our ode service to provide
        cross-platform reporting for vod content viewed beyond the television set
        (e.g., internet streaming, portable and mobile devices).  we currently have
        all the data from major mvpds for multiple platforms, totaling approximately
        eight million households.  we intend to sign more data providers to expand
        our household coverage and create a large amount of cross-platform information,
        similar to how we use our large amount of information in linear tv.see below
        for a discussion within the \u201cinnovation, research, development and technology\u201d
        section for more information on a comprehensive product solution which combines
        both our tv and ondemand everywhere\u00ae data assets.  we continue to work
        to obtain and/or incorporate data from new and existing providers relating
        to online, mobile and ott content.  we are well positioned to continue to
        grow this business by adding new clients and adjusting rates as business activity
        increases and as advanced advertising technology is rolled out by the industry.
        movies everywhere\u2122 as the global movie currency, precisely measuring
        movie viewership from more than 90% of the worldwide box offices, rentrak
        goes beyond simply reporting what movies people saw to answer three key questions:
        will they go? how much did they spend? and, what did they think?  our most
        significant products for measurement of box office results, as well as audience
        sentiment, within our movies everywhere\u2122 services include box office
        essentials\u00ae, posttrak\u00ae and preact\u2122.  box office essentials\u00ae
        provides a full census measurement of domestic and international theatrical
        gross receipts and attendance information combined with detailed analytics
        to motion picture studios and movie theater owners in 36 countries.  rentrak
        is the only provider of this key information to the motion picture industry.  we
        provide studios with access to box office performance information pertaining
        to specific motion pictures and movie theater circuits, including real-time,
        geographic-specific and historical information.  data is obtained via internet
        or phone connectivity  to theater box offices and is collected for an aggregate
        of more than 90% of all movie theaters in the united states, canada, russia,
        china, hong kong, the united kingdom, ireland, italy, australia, new zealand,
        japan, south korea, taiwan, germany, austria, the netherlands, france, mexico,
        colombia, venezuela, argentina, brazil, spain, portugal, chile, bolivia, costa
        rica, el salvador, guatemala, honduras, malaysia, singapore, nicaragua, panama,
        paraguay, and peru.  box office essentials\u00ae delivers box office results
        from more than 100,000 movie screens in 36 countries throughout the world.  we
        are also currently expanding into other locations, such as india and south
        africa, and plan to report on these areas in the coming months.posttrak\u00ae
        is our exit polling service, which delivers additional real-time insights
        relating to a movie\u2019s performance, such as audience reaction about the
        film, as well as specific demographic information relating to attendance,
        such as gender, ethnicity and age.  preact\u2122, which was launched during
        the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, is a long-lead measurement tool that helps
        clients gauge the performance of a theatrical marketing campaign.  preact\u2122
        allows users to effectively monitor the strength of a film\u2019s marketing
        campaign up to a year in advance of its release by monitoring audience sentiment
        from social media.  preact\u2122 quantifies these insights, allowing users
        the opportunity to modify their campaigns accordingly during the critical
        marketing stage of a film.   box office essentials\u00ae information is used
        around the world by major news channels, such as cnbc, as well as major internet
        sites, \u00a0such as yahoo and in major news publications around the world,
        like bloomberg news, the wall street journal, the hollywood reporter, usa
        today, and the new york times, to name a few.\u00a0 \u00a0we are the source
        for box office reporting globally.\u00a0 we have long-term relationships with
        each of the major hollywood studios (\u201cglobal clients\u201d) in the united
        states and abroad.  currently, there are no competitors who provide this service,
        and we believe that the barriers to entry are quite high because the global
        clients prefer a single system with world-wide reporting capabilities.  in
        particular, our service provides these global clients with access to information
        relating to all other market participants.other services our other services
        include products relating to physical content in the home video rental industry,
        the most significant of which is studio direct revenue sharing (\u201cdrs\u201d).studio
        direct revenue sharing (drs) is a service that grants content providers timely
        and consistent insights, plus valuable checks and balances, regarding how
        both their video products and their retail customers are performing.  data
        7relating to rented entertainment content is received on physical product
        under established agreements on a fee-for-service basis.these services include
        entertainment content relating to units rented and/or sold by large online
        retailers, kiosk operators, and \u201cbrick-and-mortar\u201d retailers, such
        as netflix, redbox and hastings entertainment (\u201cdrs retailers\u201d).  our
        services are tailored to meet the needs of content providers, which include
        major studios and independent program suppliers, such as twentieth century
        fox home entertainment, inc., warner home video, and sony pictures home entertainment,
        inc.  for each\u00a0drs client, we collect, process, audit, summarize and
        report the number of transactions and corresponding revenue generated on each
        title distributed to drs retailers on a revenue sharing basis.  we also provide
        in-depth inventory tracking by title, retailer and location.  additionally,
        we conduct numerous periodic physical and electronic audits of drs retailers,
        combined with actual testing of transactions processed through their pos systems,
        to ensure all drs inventory is utilized in a manner consistent with the terms
        of the drs retailer\u2019s revenue sharing arrangement with our drs clients.innovation,
        research, development and technology we are making significant investments
        in our systems which support our existing service lines.  we continue to integrate
        various third-party databases with our products, which we believe will help
        advertisers deliver the right message at the right time to the right consumer
        group.  we continue to build our analytic capabilities, which enable us to
        move our products from data-based to more comprehensive and applicable knowledge-based
        products and services.  these expenditures will likely increase our costs
        over the next twelve months.  we believe we will be able to leverage these
        investments and generate revenue and earnings streams that contribute to our
        overall success.  we are also investing significant resources in, and continue
        to develop and expand, our comprehensive services that provide business insights,
        research and analytics across multiple media platforms to provide our clients
        with insight into movies and tv from every viewing device.  our comprehensive
        services will include tv, dvr, internet tv, mobile, digital and vod.  this
        system is being designed to compile usage data, using common metrics, to illustrate
        each platform\u2019s individual contribution and compare it against other
        media platforms.  with the ability to track records across various media,
        this new multiscreen service will be designed to allow users to comprehend
        how content is being consumed by end users, interpret the effect such consumption
        has on other media platforms, understand consumer adoption of new platforms,
        visualize cross-platform consumption and support more complex advertising
        models by targeting audiences on every platform. competitionour primary competitors
        in these markets are nielsen, kantar (a subsidiary of wpp group) and tivo,
        which are companies with significantly greater resources than rentrak.  nielsen\u2019s,
        tivo\u2019s and kantar\u2019s services are largely based on a sampling methodology
        with a small sample in each market which is used to measure television viewing
        behaviors, and are currently the television industry\u2019s standard measurement
        of television ratings behavior for advertising purposes, referred to as the
        sample currency.  we compete in these markets primarily on the basis of product
        performance.  our services and systems differ from a sample service in that
        we offer a measurement system based on a massive amount of passively-collected
        viewing activity, which results in far more granular, reliable and predictable
        solutions as compared to the small, compensated sample approach used by most
        of our competitors.  we refer to our approach as the \u201ccensus-like currency\u201d
        and project the results to local and national levels across multiple platforms.  this
        method results in granular levels of processing from billions of transactions
        and establishes us as the only company that provides television ratings in
        a census-like currency.  we believe this positions us to offer a more comprehensive,
        representative, targeted, and relevant system that networks, stations, agencies
        and advertisers are demanding and, consequently, that the market will continue
        to purchase our measurement products.          8trademarks, copyrights, proprietary

        essentials\u2122 services face various obstacles to widespread market adoption,
        including competition from companies with significantly greater resources
        than ours.our entertainment essentials\u2122 services are dependent on several
        factors for long-term success, including our ability to compete with larger
        and more seasoned competitors in this market.  our primary competitors currently
        are nielsen, kantar and tivo.  each of these competitors has significantly
        greater resources than we do, which could allow them to become more formidable
        competitors with enhanced technology service solutions.  additionally, we
        face other obstacles.  for instance, we may be unable to reasonably obtain
        data and/or data providers may be reluctant or ultimately decide not to grant
        us adequate access to their digital transaction data, which is a key component
        of our systems.  the owners of data may also impose greater restrictions on
        the use and reporting of such data, which may make it difficult to fully realize
        the opportunities we anticipate for our products and related services.  further,
        the marketplace (such as advertisers, advertising agencies and television
        networks) may be reluctant to adopt a new standard of viewership measurement.  these
        factors could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow these services,
        which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
        financial condition and cash flows.9we may be unable to obtain requisite data
        and other content to source our systems which provide our entertainment essentials\u2122
        services.our entertainment essentials\u2122 services rely on data collected
        from a wide variety of sources.  once received, the data must be reviewed,
        processed, integrated and, at times, converted to our required file format.  if
        we are unable to obtain quality data feeds and process that data in a timely
        manner, we may not be able to meet the needs of our clients, and we could
        lose clients.  the loss of a significant number of entertainment essentials\u2122
        clients would have an adverse impact on our ability to grow our entertainment
        essentials\u2122 lines of business, which could result in a material adverse
        effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  we
        have operations outside of the united states that subject us to legal, business,
        political, cultural and other risks of international operations.we operate
        globally, which subjects us to a number of risks and burdens, including:\u2022staffing
        and managing international operations across different geographic areas; \u2022multiple,
        conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\u2022the possibility
        of protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;\u2022price
        and currency exchange rates and controls;\u2022taxes and tariffs;\u2022different
        business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to intellectual
        property;\u2022difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, including longer
        payment cycles;\u2022political, social, and economic instability; \u2022designing
        and maintaining effective operating and financial controls;\u2022the possibility
        of failure of internal controls, including any failure to detect unauthorized
        transactions; and\u2022increased costs relating to personnel management as
        a result of government and other regulations.in addition, economic conditions
        in our overseas markets may negatively impact the demand for our products
        abroad and benefits we receive from those operations.we may acquire or invest
        in other companies, products or technologies, which may be costly, dilutive
        to stockholders and, in the event we experience difficulties in assimilating
        and integrating the personnel, technologies, operating systems and products
        and services of acquired businesses, less beneficial than we anticipate.as
        part of our business strategy, we may acquire or invest in other companies,
        products or technologies that complement our current product offerings, enhance
        our technical capabilities, expand our operations into new markets or offer
        other growth opportunities.  such acquisitions may be costly and potentially
        dilutive to existing shareholders in the event we offer capital stock as consideration
        in an acquisition.  acquisitions could also pose risks to our operations and
        operating results, including the possibilities of:\u2022increased costs relating
        to the integration of acquired businesses or technologies;\u2022difficulties
        assimilating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies or products
        into our company;\u2022loss of key personnel at an acquired business who decide
        not to work for us;\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from our
        existing operations; \u2022adverse effects on relationships with our existing
        suppliers, customers or partners; \u2022a need for additional capital or debt
        financing to complete acquisitions; and\u2022the impairment of intangible
        assets acquired.the described risks would be magnified as the size of an acquisition
        increases or if the acquisitions are in geographic or business markets in
        which we have little or no prior experience.  as a result of these and other
        challenges, we may not realize any anticipated 10benefits from acquisitions
        even if we can find suitable acquisition opportunities at what we believe
        to be attractive valuations, which we do not assure.economic conditions could
        negatively impact our business.we primarily operate within the media, advertising
        and entertainment industry.  our overall success depends on the success of
        national networks and local stations, studios, cable operators, data providers,
        advertisers, and advertising agencies.  the success of these businesses is
        dependent on consumer economic activity.  for example, our box office essentials\u00ae
        clients depend on consumers being interested in, and financially able to attend,
        movies in theaters.  changes in the economic climate and consumer spending
        could impact the financial condition of our clients.  such changes that affect
        our clients could, in turn, decrease the demand for our products, which could
        have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition
        and cash flows.additionally, if our clients experience financial difficulties,
        they may be unable to continue to purchase our services or pay for services
        in a timely manner, if at all.  this could have a material adverse effect
        on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  we face
        intense competition in the markets in which we operate and those in which
        we are currently developing new service offerings.some of our competitors
        have extensive distribution networks, long-standing relationships with our
        suppliers and customers, stronger brand name recognition and significantly
        greater financial resources than we do.  these factors may enable our competition
        to have increased bargaining and purchasing power relating to resources that
        could enable them to operate in a more cost effective manner and/or to surpass
        our technological advancements.  this could have a material adverse effect
        on our ability to grow our lines of business.our drs business is dependent
        on studios maintaining direct revenue sharing relationships with \u201cbrick-and-mortar,\u201d
        kiosks and online retailers. we currently collect, process, audit, summarize
        and report transactional data relating to rental and sales activity of home
        entertainment content at large traditional and online retailers and kiosk
        locations that have revenue sharing agreements directly with major studios.  there
        are a number of risks that may adversely affect the size and profitability
        of this drs business.  first and foremost, our business is dependent on the
        drs clients maintaining drs relationships with the drs retailers.  should
        these clients end those relationships, they would have no need for our services.  second,
        our clients could decide to invest the resources necessary to provide these
        services internally.  lastly, if the overall size of the home entertainment
        rental market contracts significantly, or the large \u201cbrick-and-mortar\u201d
        and online retailers\u2019 share of the overall rental market declines substantially,
        the amount of data we process and audit on behalf of our clients would also
        be reduced, resulting in a corresponding decrease in our revenue.  these and
        other factors could potentially reduce the demand for our drs services and
        the quantity of data we process, which would negatively affect our results
        of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  the future success of
        our company is highly dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our base
        of clients who subscribe to our entertainment  essentials\u2122 suite of services.our
        success depends on effective software solutions, marketing, sales and customer
        relations for our entertainment essentials\u2122 services, as well as acceptance
        of future enhancements and new services by our existing and prospective clients.  if
        we are unable to both retain existing clients and secure new clients for our
        entertainment essentials\u2122 services, our results of operations, financial
        condition and cash flows will be adversely affected.we have voluntarily applied
        for accreditation from the media rating council (\u201cmrc\u201d) for certain
        tv essentials\u00ae products and services within our entertainment essentials\u2122
        lines of business and we cannot predict when we will receive such accreditation,
        if at all.  we have voluntarily applied for accreditation from the mrc for
        our tv essentials\u00ae products and services. the mrc is a third party nonprofit
        industry association whose members consist of companies within our industry,
        including television broadcasters, cable casters, advertisers, internet organizations,
        advertising agencies and industry trade associations.  the mrc\u2019s goal
        is to ensure measurement services are valid, reliable and effective.  while
        we believe we will be successful in achieving this accreditation, and we have
        made significant investments and progress towards this initiative, there is
        no assurance we will receive this accreditation in the near future, if at
        all, and we cannot predict the impact this accreditation would have on our
        business. 11our entertainment essentials\u2122 services are highly dependent
        on employees who are skilled and experienced in information technologies.  if
        we are unable to attract, hire and retain high quality information technology
        personnel at a reasonable cost, we may not be able to meet the needs of existing
        clients, enhance existing services, or develop new lines of business.  this
        inability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
        financial condition and cash flows. the market for on demand advertising has
        been slow to develop and may grow slowly or not at all.we have made significant
        investments in developing our tracking module for advertisements in on demand
        programming.  the success of our on demand ad tracking module is dependent
        on several uncertain factors, including market adoption of on demand advertising,
        rollout of dynamic ad insertion technologies, and the automation of files
        regarding the location of advertising in on demand content.  if the market
        does not develop, we may be unable to recoup our investments.measurement services
        are receiving a high level of consumer group and government scrutiny relating
        to the privacy issues around the methodologies used in targeted advertising.although
        we are confident that our anonymous data aggregation methodologies are compliant
        with all current privacy laws, it is possible that privacy trends and market
        perceptions of the transparency of data could result in additional government
        restrictions or limitations on the use of that data, which would adversely
        affect many of our products.  we believe it is unlikely that we will be required
        to change or limit our products.  nonetheless, if additional government restrictions
        are imposed, such restrictions could slow our ability to realize a return
        on our investments in new data-driven products or result in additional costs
        not currently anticipated.our services are highly dependent on the effective
        and efficient use of technology and our overall information management infrastructure.  if
        we are unable to acquire, establish and maintain our information management
        systems to ensure accurate, reliable and timely data processed in an efficient
        and cost effective manner, we may not be able to meet the needs of existing
        clients, enhance existing services or develop new lines of business.  this
        inability could have an adverse effect on our business and long-term growth
        prospects.interruption or failure of our information technology and communications
        systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services,
        which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results. the availability
        of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information
        technology and communications systems.  our systems are vulnerable to damage
        or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications
        failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist
        attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems.  our data centers are located
        in areas with potential risk of earthquakes.  our data centers are also subject
        to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential
        disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties.
        some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning
        cannot account for all eventualities.  the occurrence of a natural disaster,
        a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial
        reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result
        in lengthy interruptions in our service.  in addition, our products and services
        are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities.  any
        errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or damage to or failure
        of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services, which could
        reduce our revenue and results of operations. the loss of our executive officers
        and key employees could have an adverse impact on our business and development
        initiatives.  we believe that the development of our business has been, and
        will continue to be, dependent on certain key executives and employees of
        rentrak.  the loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse
        effect upon our business and development, and there is no assurance that adequate
        replacements could be found in the event of their unavailability. our stock
        is subject to price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors, many
        of which are beyond our control and may prevent our shareholders from reselling
        our common stock at a profit.the trading price of our common stock has, at
        times, experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile.  for
        example, our common stock price has fluctuated from a high of $66.95 to a
        low of $19.92 for the 52 weeks ended march\u00a031, 2014. this market volatility,
        as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce
        the market price of our common 12stock.  the trading price of our common stock
        may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond
        our control.  these factors include:\u2022quarterly variations in our results
        of operations or those of our competitors;\u2022announcements by us or our
        competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial
        relationships, or capital commitments;\u2022recommendations by securities
        analysts or changes in earnings estimates;\u2022announcements about our earnings
        that are not in line with analyst expectations;\u2022announcements by our
        competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations;\u2022the
        volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\u2022sales
        of stock by us or by our shareholders (including sales by our directors, executive
        officers and other employees); and\u2022short sales, hedging and other derivative
        transactions on shares of our common stock.oregon law and our shareholder
        rights plan may have anti-takeover effects.the oregon control share act and
        the business combination act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant
        amount of voting stock to exercise control over us.  these provisions may
        have the effect of lengthening the time required to acquire control of us
        through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors.  in
        may 2005, we adopted a shareholder rights plan, which has the effect of making
        it more difficult for a person to acquire control of us in a transaction not
        approved by our board of directors.  the provisions of the oregon control
        share act and the business combination act and our shareholder rights plan
        could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control
        of us, could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market
        price of our common stock and could materially adversely impact the market
        price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock.",

        1 - businessacquisitionson february 16, 2012, we completed the acquisition
        of the video conferencing business of israel-based vcon video conferencing,
        ltd. (\u201cvcon\u201d). vcon was a pioneer in software based video conferencing
        solutions with product offerings that include group video conferencing endpoints,
        desktop video conferencing endpoints, video conferencing infrastructure solutions
        and software development kits. this acquisition and the combination of our
        streaming and digital signage technologies has provided us with complementary
        technology opportunities allowing us to enter new growth markets. pursuant
        to the asset purchase agreement, clearone paid consideration of $4.6 million
        in cash to vcon for all the assets, including intellectual property, fixed
        assets and inventory, and assumed no debt. on january\u00a07, 2014, we entered
        into an agreement to acquire spontania from spain-based dialcom networks,
        s.l. in an all-cash deal for \u20ac3.65 million (approximately us $5.0 million).
        spontania is a software-based cloud collaboration solution which combines
        the benefits of video conferencing and web conferencing into an enterprise
        solution that can scale to tens of thousands of users.  the addition of spontania
        is expected to make clearone the only company offering an entirely software-based
        video conferencing product line that provides on-premise and cloud-based software-as-a-service
        (saas) and platform-as-a-service (paas) solutions and is expected to complement
        clearone\u2019s existing premise-based, enterprise video conferencing offering,
        collaborate \u00ae, obtained from the  vcon acquisition. clearone plans to
        fund the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the spontania business
        with available cash and will not assume any debt or cash. the acquisition
        is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2014, subject to customary
        closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. on march\u00a07,
        2014, we completed the acquisition of sabine, inc. which will provide the
        company with reliable and exclusive access to the wireless microphones that
        are a critical component of clearone\u2019s complete microphone portfolio.
        under the terms of the transaction, clearone paid approximately $7.20 million
        in cash and approximately $1.50 million in clearone shares. in addition, clearone
        paid off sabine debt of $1.25 million and may be required to make earn-out
        payments over the next three years based on achievement of certain performance
        criteria.\u00a0 clearone expects to maintain sabine operations at its current

        configurations for digital signage applications. by using the composer desktop
        software application or websuite application through software as a service
        (saas) or entry level server (els) with aavelin media players, the contents
        can be managed, scheduled and published to one or many media players to display
        on screens. our roomroster-branded room information solution is a combination
        of display and data wrapped in one design. it consists of the room sign and
        database integration used to display room schedules and other information
        in real-time.marketing and saleswe primarily use a two-tier channel model
        through which we sell our commercial products to a worldwide network of independent
        audiovisual, information technology and telecommunications distributors, who
        then sell our products to independent systems integrators, dealers, and value-added
        resellers, who in turn work directly with the end-users of our products for
        product fulfillment and installation, if needed. our products are also specified
        and recommended by professional audio-video consultants. we also sell our
        commercial products directly to certain dealers, systems integrators, value-added
        resellers, and end-users. we sell our residential products through a global
        network of residential electronics dealers, system integrators, and other
        value-added resellers.during the year ended december\u00a031, 2013, approximately
        $32.3 million, or 65% of our total product sales, were generated in the united
        states and product sales of approximately $17.3 million, or 35% of our total
        product sales, were generated outside the united states. revenue from product
        sales to customers in the united states was approximately $30.3 million, or
        65% of total product sales and revenue from products outside of the united
        states was approximately $16.1 million and accounted for approximately 35%
        of our total product sales for the year ended december\u00a031, 2012. we sell
        directly to our distributors, resellers and end-users in approximately 70
        countries worldwide. we anticipate that the portion of our total product revenue
        from international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our
        total revenue as we further enhance our focus on developing new products,
        establishing new channel partners, strengthening our presence in key growth
        areas, complying with regional environmental regulatory standards, and improving
        product localization with country-specific product documentation and marketing
        materials.distributors, resellers and independent integratorswe sold our products
        directly to approximately 520 distributors and direct resellers throughout
        the world during 2013. distributors and resellers purchase our products at
        a discount from list price and resell them worldwide to hundreds of independent
        system integrators, telephony value-added resellers, it value-added resellers,
        and pc dealers on a non-exclusive basis. our distributors maintain their own
        inventory and accounts receivable and are required to provide technical and
        non-technical support for our products to the next level of distribution participants.
        we work with our distributors and resellers to establish appropriate inventory
        stocking levels. we also work with our distributors and resellers to maintain
        relationships with our existing systems integrators, dealers, and other value-added
        resellers. while dealers, resellers, and system integrators all sell our products
        directly to the end-users, system integrators typically add significant value
        to each sale by combining our products with products from other manufacturers
        as part of an integrated system solution. commercial dealers and value-added
        resellers usually purchase our products from distributors and may bundle our
        products with products from other manufacturers for resale to the end-user.
        we maintain close working relationships with all our reseller partners and
        offer them education and training on all of our products.marketing| 6 |table
        of contentsitem 1 - businessmuch of our marketing effort is conducted in conjunction
        with our channel partners who provide leverage for us in reaching existing
        and prospective customers worldwide. we also regularly attend industry forums
        and exhibit our products at multiple regional and international trade shows,
        often with our channel partners. these trade shows provide exposure for our
        brand and products to a wide audience. we market our clearone-branded commercial
        products on our website www.clearone.com and our magicbox branded digital
        signage products on our website www.magicboxinc.com. we also conduct public
        relations initiatives to get press coverage and product reviews in industry
        and non-industry publications alike.customerswe do not get any reports from
        our distributors and resellers that identify our end-users. as a result, we
        do not know whether any end-user accounted for more than 10 percent of our
        total revenue during any of the periods reported in this annual report. however,
        revenues included sales to starin marketing, which represented approximately
        18.2% of consolidated revenue, and vso marketing, which represented approximately
        10.8% of consolidated revenue during the year ended december\u00a031, 2013.  during
        the year ended december\u00a031, 2012, revenues included sales to starin marketing,
        which represented 17.5% of our consolidated revenue during that period. as
        discussed above, distributors facilitate product sales to a large number of
        independent systems integrators, dealers, and value-added resellers, and subsequently
        to their end-users. the loss of one or more distributors could reduce revenue
        and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  our
        shipped orders on which we had not recognized revenue were $4.2 million and
        $3.6 million as of december\u00a031, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  as of december\u00a031,
        2013, we had a backlog of un-shipped orders of approximately $473 thousand.competitionthe
        audio visual product markets are characterized by intense competition, rapidly
        evolving technology, and increased business consolidation. we compete with
        businesses having substantially greater financial, research and product development,
        manufacturing, marketing, and other resources. if we are not able to continually
        design, manufacture, and successfully market new or enhanced products or services
        that are comparable or superior to those provided by our competitors and at
        comparable or better prices, we could experience pricing pressures and reduced
        sales, gross profit margins, profits, and market share, each of which could
        have a materially adverse effect on our business. our competitors vary within
        each product category. we believe we are able to differentiate ourselves and
        therefore successfully compete as a result of the high audio quality of our
        products resulting from a combination of proprietary and highly advanced audio
        signal processing technologies and networking technology in the form of trade
        secrets and patented intellectual property, technical and channel support
        services, and the strength of our channels and brands.we believe the principal
        factors driving sales are the following:\u2022quality, features and functionality,
        and ease of use of the products;\u2022broad and deep global channel partnerships;\u2022significant
        established history of successful worldwide installations for diverse vertical

        and marketing.in the professional audio conferencing system and sound reinforcement
        markets, our main competitors include biamp, crestron, extron, harman/bss,
        lectrosonics, peavey, phoenix, polycom, shure and vaddio and their original
        equipment manufacturing (oem) partners, along with several other companies
        potentially poised to enter the market. we occupy the number one position
        in the global professional audio conferencing market with nearly 50% of the
        global market share. in the traditional tabletop conferencing market, we face
        significant competition from avaya (konftel), phoenix, and polycom, and especially
        from their oem partnerships. a significant portion of the tabletop market
        is covered by sales through oem partnerships. while we believe max products
        have unique features and superior quality, our limited oem partnerships and
        pricing pressures from higher volume competitors limit our ability to expand
        our existing share of this market. in the professional microphones market,
        our primary competitors include audio-technica, audix, polycom, revolabs,
        sennheiser, shure, and their oem partners. our primary competitors in the
        personal conferencing market are gn netcom (jabra), phoenix audio, plantronics,
        polycom, yamaha and their oem partners. our video conferencing products face
        tremendous competition from well established players, including avaya (radvision),
        cisco, logitech (lifesize), polycom and vidyo. we believe the | 7 |table of

        intense competition from a few well-established corporations of diversified
        capabilities and strengths, including amx, biamp, crestron, extron, and haivision.
        we believe that our pioneering and patented streamnet technology delivers
        superior audio and video streaming performance and flexibility and provides
        us with a competitive edge over other industry players. in digital signage,

        regarding product safety, product operational agency compliance, the materials
        used in manufacturing, the process of disposing of electronic equipment and
        the efficient use of energy may require extensive lead-time to obtain regulatory
        approvals of new products in both domestic and international markets. such
        regulations may impact our ability to expand our sales in a timely and cost-effective
        manner and, as a result, our business could be harmed.sources and availability
        of raw materialswe manufacture our products through electronics manufacturing
        services (\"ems\") providers, who are generally responsible for sourcing and
        procuring required raw materials and components. most of the components that
        our ems providers require for manufacturing our products are readily available
        from a number of sources.we continually work with our ems providers to seek
        alternative sources for all our components and raw material requirements to
        ensure higher quality and better pricing. most of our ems providers and their
        vendors are duly qualified by our corporate quality assurance process. we
        work with our ems providers to ensure that raw materials and components conform
        to our specifications.manufacturingcurrently, all of our products except digital
        signage products are manufactured by ems providers. our primary ems provider
        is flextronics. the digital signage products are assembled in our salt lake
        city, utah facility.seasonalityour revenue has historically been the strongest
        in the fourth quarter and the weakest in the first quarter, even though a
        consistent pattern could not be established for seasonality between the quarters.
        there can be no assurance that any historic sales patterns will continue and,
        as a result, sales for any prior quarter are not necessarily indicative of
        the sales to be expected in any future quarter.research and product developmentwe
        are committed to research and product development and view our continued investment
        in research and product development as a key ingredient to our long-term business
        success. our research and product development expenditures were approximately
        $7.6 million during the year ended december\u00a031, 2013 and $8.3 million
        during the year ended december\u00a031, 2012.our core competencies in research
        and product development include (a) many audio technologies, including acoustic
        echo cancellation, noise cancellation and other advanced adaptive digital
        signal processing technologies, (b) networking and multimedia streaming technologies,
        and (c) video technologies. we also have expertise in wireless technologies,
        voip, software and network application, and digital signage system development.
        we believe that continued investment in our core technological competencies
        is vital to developing new products and to enhancing existing products.intellectual
        property and other proprietary rightswe believe that our success depends in
        part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. we rely on a combination
        of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws and confidentiality
        agreements and processes to protect our proprietary rights. the laws of foreign
        countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as
        the laws of the united states.| 8 |table of contentsitem 1 - businesswe generally
        require our employees, certain customers and partners to enter into confidentiality
        and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any confidential aspect of
        our technology, services, or business. in addition, our employees are required
        to assign to us any proprietary information, inventions, or other technology
        created during the term of their employment with us. however, these precautions
        may not be sufficient to protect us from misappropriation or infringement

        1a. risk factorsinvestors should carefully consider the risks described below.
        the risks described below are not the only ones we face and there are risks
        that we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial
        that may also impair our business operations. any of these risks could harm
        our business. the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly
        due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
        in assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information
        contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k,
        including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.risks relating
        to our businesswe face intense competition in all markets for our products
        and services and our operating results will be adversely affected if we cannot
        compete effectively against other companies.the markets for our products and
        services are characterized by intense competition, pricing pressures and rapid
        technological change. our competitive landscape continues to rapidly evolve,
        in particular with respect to our video-related services and products, as
        we move into new markets for video collaboration such as mobile, social and
        cloud-delivered video.  we compete with businesses having substantially greater
        financial, research and product development, manufacturing, marketing, and
        other resources than we do. if we are not able to continually design, manufacture,
        and successfully introduce new or enhanced products or services that are comparable
        or superior to those provided by our competitors and at comparable or better
        prices, we could experience pricing pressures and reduced sales, gross profit
        margins, profits, and market share, each of which could have a materially
        adverse effect on our business.difficulties in estimating customer demand
        in our products segment could harm our profit margins.orders from our distributors
        and other distribution participants are based on demand from end-users. prospective
        end-user demand is difficult to measure. this means that our revenue during
        any fiscal quarter could be adversely impacted by low end-user demand, which
        could in turn negatively affect orders we receive from distributors and dealers.
        our expectations for both short and long-term future net revenues are based
        on our own estimates of future demand. revenue for any particular time period
        is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. we typically ship products
        within a short time after we receive an order; consequently, unshipped backlog
        has not historically been a good indicator of future revenue. we believe that
        the level of backlog is dependent in part on our ability to forecast revenue
        mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly. a significant portion of our customers\u2019
        orders are received during the last month of the quarter. we budget the amount
        of our expenses based on our revenue estimates. if our estimates of sales
        are not accurate and we experience unforeseen variability in our revenue and
        operating results, we may be unable to adjust our expense levels accordingly
        and our gross profit and results of operations will be adversely affected.
        higher inventory levels or stock shortages may also result from difficulties
        in estimating customer demand.our sales depend to a certain extent on government
        funding and regulation.in the audio conferencing products market, the revenue
        generated from sales of our audio conferencing products for distance learning
        and courtroom facilities depends on government funding. in the event government
        funding for such initiatives was reduced or became unavailable, our sales
        could be negatively impacted. additionally, many of our products are subject
        to governmental regulations. new regulations could impact sales in a materially
        adverse manner.environmental laws and regulations subject us to a number of
        risks and could result in significant costs and impact on revenue.regulations
        regarding the materials used in manufacturing, the process of disposing of
        electronic equipment and the efficient use of energy require us to take additional
        time to obtain regulatory approvals of new products in international markets.
        such regulations may impact our ability to expand our sales in a timely and
        cost-effective manner and, as a result, our business could be harmed.our profitability
        may be adversely affected by our continuing dependence on our distribution
        channels.we market our products primarily through a network of distributors
        who in turn sell our products to value-added resellers. all of our agreements
        with such distributors and other distribution participants are non-exclusive,
        terminable at will by either party, and generally short-term. no assurances
        can be given that any or all such distributors or other distribution participants
        will continue their relationship with us. distributors and, to a lesser extent,
        value-added resellers cannot easily be replaced and any | 10 |table of contentsitem
        1a - risk factorsloss of revenues from these and other sources or the our
        inability to reduce expenses to compensate for such loss of revenue could
        adversely affect our net revenue and profit margins.although we rely on our
        distribution channels to sell our products, our distributors and other distribution
        participants are not obligated to devote any specified amount of time, resources,
        or efforts to the marketing of our products, or to sell a specified number
        of our products. there are no prohibitions on distributors or other resellers
        offering products that are competitive with our products, and some do offer
        competitive products. the support of our products by distributors and other
        distribution participants may depend on the competitive strength of our products
        and the price incentives we offer for their support. if our distributors and
        other distribution participants are not committed to our products, our revenue
        and profit margins may be adversely affected.additionally, we offer our distributors
        price protection on their inventory of our products. if we reduce the list
        price of our products, we will compensate our distributors for the respective
        products that remain in their inventory on the date the price adjustment becomes
        effective, provided that they have taken delivery of the products within the
        last 35 days. our net revenue and profit margins could be adversely affected
        if we reduce product prices significantly or distributors happen to have significant
        on-hand inventory of the affected product at the time of a price reduction.
        further, if we do not have sufficient cash resources to compensate distributors
        on terms satisfactory to them or us, our price protection obligations may
        prevent us from reacting quickly to changing market conditions.product development
        delays or defects could harm our competitive position and reduce our revenue.we
        have in the past experienced, and may again experience, technical difficulties
        and delays with the development and introduction of new products. many of
        the products we develop contain sophisticated and complicated circuitry, software
        and components and utilize manufacturing techniques involving new technologies.
        potential difficulties in the development process that we may experience include
        the following : (a) meeting required specifications and regulatory standards;
        (b) hiring and keeping a sufficient number of skilled developers; (c) meeting
        market expectations for performance; (d) obtaining prototype products at anticipated
        cost levels; (e) having the ability to identify problems or product defects
        in the development cycle; and (f) achieving necessary manufacturing efficiencies.once
        new products reach the market, they may have defects, or may be met by unanticipated
        new competitive products, which could adversely affect market acceptance of
        these products and our reputation. if we are not able to manage and minimize
        such potential difficulties, our business and results of operations could
        be negatively affected.we rely on reporting of distribution channel inventory
        by our distributors to recognize revenue from product sales to them, which
        could turn out to be inaccurate.we defer recognition of revenue from product
        sales to distributors until the return privilege has expired, which approximates
        when product is sold-through to customers of our distributors. at each quarter-end,
        we evaluate the inventory in the channel through information provided by our
        distributors. we use this information to determine the amount of inventory
        in the channel, and the appropriate revenue and cost of goods sold associated
        with those channel products. we cannot guarantee that the third party data
        as reported will be accurate.   we sample test the inventory of a limited
        number of distributors on an annual basis, most recently in the fourth quarter
        of 2013, to gain a comfort level of inventory levels reported, however, inventory
        levels could  contain inaccuracies for items we do not sample. we depend on
        an outsourced manufacturing strategy, and any disruption in outsourced services
        could negatively impact our product availability and revenues.we outsource
        the manufacturing of all of our products to electronics manufacturing services
        (\"ems\") providers located in both the u.s. and asia. if any of these ems
        providers experience (i) difficulties in obtaining sufficient supplies of
        components, (ii) component prices significantly exceeding anticipated costs,
        (iii) an interruption in their operations, or (iv) otherwise suffers capacity
        constraints, we could experience a delay in production and shipping of these
        products, which would have a negative impact on our revenue. should there
        be any disruption in services due to natural disaster, such as the natural
        disaster in japan in 2011, economic or political difficulties, transportation
        restrictions, acts of terror, quarantines or other restrictions associated
        with infectious diseases, or other similar events, or any other reason, such
        disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business. operating
        in the international outsourcing environment exposes us to certain inherent
        risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs,
        and potentially adverse tax consequences, which could materially affect our
        results of operations. currently, we have no second source of manufacturing
        for a portion of our products.| 11 |table of contentsitem 1a - risk factorsswitching
        from one ems provider to another is an expensive, difficult and a time consuming
        process, with serious risks to our ability to successfully transfer our manufacturing
        operations. our operations, and consequently our revenues and profitability,
        could be materially adversely affected if we are forced to switch from any
        of our ems providers to another ems provider due to any of a number of factors,
        including financial difficulties faced by the manufacturer, disagreements
        in pricing negotiations between us and the manufacturer or organizational
        changes in the manufacturer.the cost of delivered product from our ems providers
        is a direct function of their ability to buy components at a competitive price
        and to realize efficiencies and economies of scale within their overall business
        structures. if they are unsuccessful in driving efficient cost models, our
        delivered costs could rise, affecting our profitability and ability to compete.
        in addition, if the ems providers are unable to achieve greater operational
        efficiencies, delivery schedules for new product development and current product
        delivery could be negatively impacted.recent regulatory requirements regarding
        the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could affect the sourcing and availability
        of raw materials to our ems providers in the manufacture of certain of our
        products.  we may be subject to costs associated with the new regulations,
        including for the diligence pertaining to the presence of any conflict minerals
        used in our products and the cost of remediation and other changes to products,
        processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  the
        impact of the regulations may result in a limited pool of suppliers who provide
        conflict free minerals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
        products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  we may face reputational
        challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently
        verify the origins for the metals used in the products we sell.  as a result,
        we may not be able to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture our products,
        which could force us to cease production or search for alternative supply
        sources, possibly at a higher cost.  such disruptions may have a material
        adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
        and cash flows.global economic conditions have adversely affected our business
        in the past and could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business
        in the future. \u00a0adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed
        to slowdowns in the communications industry and have caused a negative impact
        on the specific segments and markets in which we operate. adverse changes
        in general global economic conditions can result in reductions in capital
        expenditures by end-user customers for our products, longer sales cycles,
        the deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased
        competition. these factors have adversely impacted our operating results in
        prior periods and could also impact us again in the future. global economic
        concerns, such as the varying pace of global economic recovery, european and
        domestic debt and budget issues, the slowdown in china and india\u2019s economic
        growth and international currency fluctuations, may continue to create uncertainty
        and unpredictability in the global and national economy. a global economic
        downturn would negatively impact technology spending for our products and
        services and could materially adversely affect our business, operating results
        and financial condition. further, global economic conditions may result in
        a tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity levels in many financial
        markets, decrease in customer demand and ability to pay obligations, and extreme
        volatility in credit, equity, foreign currency and fixed income markets.\u00a0such
        adverse economic conditions could negatively impact our business, particularly
        our revenue potential, potentially causing losses on investments and the collectability
        of our accounts receivable.  these factors potentially include: the inability
        of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and
        services, customer or partner insolvencies or bankruptcies, decreased customer
        confidence to make purchasing decisions resulting in delays in their purchasing
        decisions, decreased customer demand or demand for lower-end products, or
        decreased customer ability to pay their obligations when they become due to
        us.\u00a0we are a smaller company than some of our competitors and may be
        more susceptible to market fluctuations, other adverse events, increased costs
        and less favorable purchasing terms.since we are a relatively small company,
        there is a risk that we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and
        other adverse events. in particular, we may be more susceptible to reductions
        in government and corporate spending from our government and enterprise customers.
        \u00a0we may also experience increased costs and less favorable terms from
        our suppliers than some of our larger competitors who may have greater leverage
        in their purchasing spend. any of these outcomes could result in loss of sales
        or our products being more costly to manufacture and thus less competitive.
        \u00a0any such unfavorable market fluctuations, reductions in customer spending
        or increased manufacturing costs could have a negative impact on our business
        and results of operations.| 12 |table of contentsitem 1a - risk factorsdifficulties
        in integrating past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our business.we
        acquired netstreams, a pioneer in digital media networks based on internet
        protocol (tcp/ip), in november 2009 and magicbox, a leading provider of digital
        signage services, in september 2011. in addition, we acquired substantially
        all of the assets of vcon video conferencing, ltd, a high-performance, end-to-end,
        software video conferencing solutions company in israel, in february 2012.  in
        january 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire spontania, from spain-based
        dialcom networks, s.l., which is a software-based cloud collaboration solution.
        the efficient and effective integration of these businesses into our organization
        is important to our growth. on march\u00a07, 2014, we completed the acquisition
        of sabine, inc. which will provide the company with reliable and exclusive
        access to the wireless microphones that are a critical component of clearone\u2019s
        complete microphone portfolio. under the terms of the transaction, clearone
        paid approximately $7.20 million in cash and approximately $1.50 million in
        clearone shares. in addition, clearone paid off sabine debt of $1.25 million
        and may be required to make earn-out payments over the next three years, based
        on achievement of certain performance criteria.\u00a0 clearone expects to
        maintain sabine operations at its current headquarters in alachua, florida.
        any acquisition involves numerous risks and challenges, including difficulties
        and time involved in integrating the operations, technologies and products
        of the acquired companies, entering new business or product lines, the diversion
        of our management''s attention from other business concerns, geographic dispersion
        of operations, generating market demand for expanded product lines and the
        potential loss of key customers or employees of an acquired company. failure
        to achieve the anticipated benefits of these and any future acquisitions or
        to successfully integrate the operations of these or any other companies or
        assets we acquire, could also harm our business, results of operations and
        cash flows. additionally, we cannot assure you that we will not incur material
        charges in future periods to reflect additional costs associated with these
        acquisitions or any future acquisitions we may make.conditions in israel and
        the middle east may affect the operations of our subsidiary in israel. \u00a0we
        have recently formed a subsidiary located in israel in connection with the
        acquisition of the assets of vcon video conferencing, ltd.  political, economic,
        security and military conditions in the middle east in general, and in israel
        in particular, directly affect our israeli subsidiary\u2019s operations. since
        the establishment of the state of israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts
        have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility,
        varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems
        for israel. \u00a0despite negotiations to effect peace between israel and
        its arab neighbors, the future of these peace efforts is uncertain.recent
        social unrest in various countries in the middle east have led to severe political
        instability in those countries. this continuing instability may lead to deterioration
        of the political and trade relationships that exist between the state of israel
        and these countries. in addition, this instability may affect the economy
        in the middle east as well as the global economy and marketplace. any armed
        conflicts or political instability in the region, including acts of terrorism
        or any other hostilities involving or threatening israel, would likely negatively
        affect business conditions and could make it more difficult for us to conduct
        our operations in israel, which could increase our costs and adversely affect
        our financial results.product obsolescence could harm demand for our products
        and could adversely affect our revenue and our results of operations.our industry
        is subject to technological innovations that could render existing technologies
        in our products obsolete and thereby decrease market demand for such products.
        if any of our products becomes slow-moving or obsolete and the recorded value
        of our inventory is greater than its market value, we will be required to
        write down the value of our inventory to its fair market value, which would
        adversely affect our results of operations. in limited circumstances, we are
        required to purchase components that our outsourced manufacturers use to produce
        and assemble our products. should technological innovations render these components
        obsolete, we will be required to write down the value of this inventory, which
        could adversely affect our results of operations.if we are unable to protect
        our intellectual property rights or have insufficient proprietary rights,
        our business would be materially impaired.we currently rely primarily on a
        combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, patents, patents pending,
        and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights
        in our products. no assurances can be given that others will not independently
        develop technologies similar to ours, or duplicate or design around aspects
        of our technology. in addition, we cannot assure that any patent or registered
        trademark owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged,
        or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages
        to us. costly litigation may be necessary | 13 |table of contentsitem 1a -
        risk factorsto enforce our intellectual property rights. we believe our products
        and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon any proprietary rights of
        third parties; however, we cannot ensure that third parties will not assert
        infringement claims in the future. our industry is characterized by vigorous
        protection of intellectual property rights. such claims and the resulting
        litigation can be expensive and could divert our attention, regardless of
        the merit of such claims. in the event of a successful claim, we might be
        required to license third-party technology or redesign our products, which
        may not be possible or economically feasible.we currently hold only a limited
        number of patents. to the extent that we have patentable technology for which
        we have not filed patent applications, others may be able to use such technology
        or even gain priority over us by patenting such technology themselves. with
        respect to any patent application we have filed, we cannot ensure that a patent
        will be awarded.international sales account for a significant portion of our
        net revenue and risks inherent in international sales could harm our business.international
        sales represent a significant portion of our total product revenue. we anticipate
        that the portion of our total product revenue from international sales will
        continue to increase as we further enhance our focus on developing new products
        for new markets, establishing new distribution partners, strengthening our
        presence in emerging economies, and improving product localization with country-specific
        product documentation and marketing materials. our international business
        is subject to the financial and operating risks of conducting business internationally,
        including the following:\u2022unexpected changes in, or the imposition of,
        additional legislative or regulatory requirements;\u2022unique or more onerous
        environmental regulations;\u2022fluctuating exchange rates;\u2022tariffs and
        other barriers;\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales operations;\u2022import
        and export restrictions;\u2022greater difficulties in accounts receivable
        collection and longer payment cycles;\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences;\u2022potential
        hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\u2022disruption
        in services due to natural disaster, economic or political difficulties, transportation,
        quarantines or other restrictions associated with infectious diseases.we may
        not be able to hire and retain qualified key and highly-skilled technical
        employees, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and may cause
        our revenue and profitability to decline.we depend on our ability to hire
        and retain qualified key and highly skilled employees to manage, research
        and develop, market, and service new and existing products. competition for
        such key and highly-skilled employees is intense, and we may not be successful
        in attracting or retaining such personnel. to succeed, we must hire and retain
        employees who are highly skilled in the rapidly changing communications and
        internet technologies. individuals who have the skills and can perform the
        services we need to provide our products and services are in great demand.
        because the competition for qualified employees in our industry is intense,
        hiring and retaining employees with the skills we need is both time-consuming
        and expensive. we may not be able to hire enough skilled employees or retain
        the employees we do hire. in addition, provisions of the sarbanes-oxley act
        of 2002 and related rules of the sec impose heightened personal liability
        on some of our key employees. the threat of such liability could make it more
        difficult to identify, hire and retain qualified key and highly-skilled employees.
        we have relied on our ability to grant stock options as a means of recruiting
        and retaining key employees. accounting regulations requiring the expensing
        of stock options will impair our future ability to provide these incentives
        without incurring associated compensation costs. if we are unable to hire
        and retain employees with the skills we seek, our ability to sell our existing
        products, systems, or services or to develop new products, systems, or services
        could be hindered with a consequent adverse effect on our business, results
        of operations, financial position, or liquidity.we rely on third-party technology
        and license agreements, the loss of any of which could negatively impact our
        business.we have licensing agreements with various suppliers for software
        and hardware incorporated into our products. these third-party licenses may
        not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at
        all. the termination or impairment | 14 |table of contentsitem 1a - risk factorsof
        these licenses could result in delays of current product shipments or delays
        or reductions in new product introductions until equivalent designs can be
        developed, licensed, and integrated, if at all possible, which would have
        a material adverse effect on our business.we may have difficulty in collecting
        outstanding receivables.we grant credit to substantially all of our customers
        without requiring collateral. in times of economic uncertainty, the risks
        relating to the granting of such credit will typically increase. although
        we monitor and mitigate the risks associated with our credit policies, we
        cannot ensure that such mitigation will be effective. we have experienced
        losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations. future losses could
        be significant and, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material
        adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.interruptions
        to our business could adversely affect our operations.as with any company,
        our operations are at risk of being interrupted by earthquake, fire, flood,
        and other natural and human-caused disasters, including disease and terrorist
        attacks. our operations are also at risk of power loss, telecommunications
        failure, human error, physical or electronic security breaches and computer
        viruses (which could leave us vulnerable to the loss of confidential proprietary
        information as well as disruption of our business activities) and other infrastructure
        and technology based problems. to help guard against such risks, we carry
        business interruption loss insurance to help compensate us for losses that
        may occur, but we cannot assure that such coverage would protect us from all
        such possible losses.changes in our tax rates could adversely affect our future
        results. we are a u.s. based company subject to tax in u.s. and foreign tax
        jurisdictions. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future
        results of operations. our future effective tax rates, which are difficult
        to predict, could be unfavorably affected by changes in, or interpretation
        of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business,
        by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries
        with low statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred
        tax assets and liabilities, or by lapses of the availability of the u.s. research
        and development tax credit, which occurred for 2012 but was reinstated on
        january 2, 2013 as part of the \u201camerican taxpayer relief act of 2012.\u201d
        the law provided for an extension of the federal research credit retroactive
        for 2012 but expired december 31, 2013. further, the accounting for stock
        compensation expense in accordance with asc 718 and uncertain tax positions
        in accordance with asc 740 could result in more unpredictability and variability
        to our future effective tax rates. risks relating to share ownershipour stock
        price fluctuates as a result of the conduct of our business and stock market
        fluctuations.the market price of our common stock has experienced significant
        fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. the market price
        of our common stock may be significantly affected by a variety of factors,
        including the following:\u2022statements or changes in opinions, ratings,
        or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating
        to the market in which we do business or relating to us specifically;\u2022disparity
        between our reported results and the projections of analysts;\u2022the shift
        in sales mix of products that we currently sell to a sales mix of lower-gross
        profit product offerings;\u2022the level and mix of inventory held by our
        distributors;\u2022the announcement of new products or product enhancements
        by us or our competitors;\u2022technological innovations by us or our competitors;\u2022success
        in meeting targeted availability dates for new or redesigned products;\u2022the
        ability to profitably and efficiently manage our supply of products and key
        components;\u2022the ability to maintain profitable relationships with our
        customers;\u2022the ability to maintain an appropriate cost structure;\u2022quarterly
        variations in our results of operations;| 15 |table of contentsitem 1a - risk
        factors\u2022general consumer confidence or market conditions, or market conditions
        specific to technology industry;\u2022domestic and international economic
        conditions;\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs;\u2022our
        ability to report financial information in a timely manner;\u2022the markets
        in which our stock is traded;\u2022our ability to integrate the companies
        we have acquired; and\u2022our ability to successfully utilize our cash reserves
        resulting from the settlement of litigation and arbitration matters.rights
        to acquire our common stock could result in dilution to other holders of our
        common stock.as of december\u00a031, 2013, we had outstanding options to acquire
        approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average
        exercise price of $5.15 per share. an additional 259,154 shares remain available
        for grant under our 2007 equity incentive plan. during the terms of these
        options, the holders thereof will have the opportunity to profit from an increase
        in the market price of the common stock. the existence of these options may
        adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional financing, and
        the holders of these options can be expected to exercise such options at a
        time when we, in all likelihood, would be able to obtain additional capital
        by offering shares of our common stock on terms more favorable to us than
        those provided by the exercise of these options. the sale of additional shares
        of our common stock could have a negative effect on the market price of our
        common stock.the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public
        market could adversely affect prevailing market prices and could impair our
        ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities. most shares
        of common stock currently outstanding are eligible for sale in the public
        market, subject in certain cases to compliance with the requirements of rule
        144 under the securities laws. shares issued upon the exercise of stock options
        granted under our stock option plan generally will be eligible for sale in
        the public market. we also have the authority to issue additional shares of
        common stock and shares of one or more series of preferred stock. the issuance
        of such shares could dilute the voting power of the currently outstanding
        shares of our common stock and could dilute earnings per share.we have previously
        identified material weaknesses in our internal controls.in our form 10-k for
        the fiscal year ending june 30, 2006 and form 10-k/a-2 for the fiscal year
        ending june 30, 2008, we reported and identified a material weakness in our
        internal controls.although we believe we have remedied this weakness through
        the commitment of considerable resources, we are always at risk that any future
        failure of our own internal controls or the internal controls at any of our
        outsourced manufacturers or partners could result in additional reported material
        weaknesses. any future failures of our internal controls could have a material
        impact on our market capitalization, results of operations, or financial position,
        or have other adverse consequences.| 16 |table of contents", "permalink_id":

        (ii)\u00a0develop, market and distribute our applications; (iii)\u00a0attract
        third parties to distribute our applications and related technology; and (iv)\u00a0attract
        advertisers.  in the case of our search services generally, our competitors
        include google, yahoo!, bing and other destination search websites and search\u2011centric
        portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or
        link to various desktop applications), third party toolbar, convenience search
        and applications providers, other search technology and convenience service
        providers (including internet access providers, social media platforms, online
        advertising networks, traditional media companies and companies that provide
        online content).  when we market our search and content services, our competitors
        include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and
        algorithmic search results.moreover, some of our current and potential competitors
        have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer
        bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources
        than we do.  as a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater
        resources to the development and promotion of their products and services,
        which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services
        relative to those offered by us.in the case of our websites business, we believe
        that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the relevance
        and authority of our search results, answers and other content, the functionality
        of our various websites, the quality of related content and features and the
        attractiveness of the services provided by our websites generally to consumers
        relative to those of our competitors.  we believe that we differentiate ask.com
        from its competitors through question and answer services that provide accurate,
        authoritative and direct answers to natural\u2011language questions (in the
        form of algorithmic search results and/or responses from other ask.com users,
        as well as indexed question and answer pairings from various websites and
        online services).  our ability to continue to differentiate ask.com from its
        competitors in this manner depends primarily upon our ability to deliver authoritative
        and trustworthy content to users, as well as our ability to attract advertisers
        to this initiative.in the case of our applications business, we believe that
        our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued
        ability to create toolbars and other applications that resonate with consumers
        (which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features, content and
        services, some of which may be owned by third parties, with quality search
        services), differentiate our toolbars and other applications from those of
        our competitors (primarily through providing customized 5table of contentstoolbars
        and access to multiple search and other services through our toolbars), secure
        cost-effective distribution arrangements with third parties and market and
        distribute our toolbars and other applications directly to consumers in a
        cost-effective manner.matchoverviewthrough the brands and businesses within

        marketplace, we generally match that consumer with up to four home services
        professionals from our network based on the type of services desired and the
        consumer''s location.  consumers can then review home services professional
        profiles and select the professional that they believe best meets their specific
        needs.  in all cases, if a match is made, the consumer is under no obligation
        to work with home service professionals referred by homeadvisor.   in addition
        to our matching services, consumers may also access our costguide, which provides

        services for home services professionals.  in 2013, homeadvisor introduced
        three new subscription offerings for home services professionals, each for
        a flat monthly fee.  the basic membership package includes membership in the
        homeadvisor network, as well the inclusion of the home services professional\u2019s
        contact information in homeadvisor\u2019s online directory, which is posted
        on www.homeadvisor.com and affiliated websites.  consumers may search this
        online directory in addition to (or in lieu of) submitting a request through
        the homeadvisor marketplace, with consumers ultimately 7table of contentsselecting
        those home services professionals they wish to work with (in lieu of homeadvisor
        providing matches) and contacting such professionals directly.  the two additional
        membership packages include all of the basic membership package services,
        plus matches through the homeadvisor marketplace and, in the case of one package,
        custom website and mobile development and hosting services as well.  since
        october 2013, homeadvisor has been marketing its subscription packages to
        existing home services professionals within its network and in the case of
        home services professionals who are new to homeadvisor , these professionals
        must sign up for one of the subscription offerings described above (versus
        being able to join the network for free and only pay for matches, which was
        the case prior to october 2013).  as of december\u00a031, 2013, approximately
        15,000 of the more than 80,000 home services professionals within the homeadvisor
        network had purchased a membership package.marketingwe market our services
        to consumers primarily through search engine marketing, as well as through
        affiliate agreements with third parties.  pursuant to these agreements, third
        parties agree to advertise and promote our services and those of our home
        services professionals on their websites and we agree to pay them a fixed
        fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through
        our website (on a cost-per-acquisition basis) or click through to our website
        (on a cost-per-click basis).  we also market our services to consumers through

        traditional offline advertising, including television.  we market our subscription
        packages to home services professionals through our sales force, as well as
        online through search engine marketing, relationships with trade associations
        and affiliate marketing relationships.revenuehomeadvisor''s revenue is derived
        primarily from fees paid by members of our network of home services professionals
        for matches with consumers made by homeadvisor (regardless of whether the
        professional ultimately provides the requested service), as well as from subscription
        fees for our new home services professional subscription offerings, fees for
        website hosting services and fees charged upon the enrollment and activation
        of new home services professionals in our network.  fees for matches vary

        as well as internet search engines and directories and with other forms of
        local advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages,
        newspapers and other offline directories.  we also compete with local and
        national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation
        services. we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend
        primarily upon the following factors:\u2022the size, quality (as determined,
        in part, by reference to our pre-screening efforts and customer ratings and
        reviews), diversity and stability of our network of home services professionals
        and the quality of the services provided by such  professionals;\u2022our

        vested options to purchase iac common stock and 150,000 unvested options to
        purchase iac common stock.  in addition, under an amended and restated governance
        agreement between iac and mr.\u00a0diller, for so long as mr.\u00a0diller
        serves as iac\u2019s chairman and senior executive, he generally has the right
        to consent to limited matters in the event that iac\u2019s ratio of total

        will consent to any of the limited matters at such time, in which case iac
        would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this

        of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as mergers, business
        combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.  in
        addition, this concentration of voting power could discourage others from
        initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction
        that may otherwise be beneficial to iac, which could adversely affect the

        will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate

        our senior management being especially critical to our success.  competition
        for well-qualified employees across iac and its various businesses is intense
        and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our
        ability to attract new employees.  while we have established programs to attract
        new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly
        our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract

        march\u00a031, 2016.  pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate
        paid listings provided by google in response to search queries generated by
        users of our search & applications properties.  in exchange for making our
        search traffic available to google, we receive a share of the revenue generated

        advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and
        parameters established by google regarding the number and placement of paid

        and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive.  changes
        to google\u2019s paid listings network efficiency, its judgment about the
        relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings from our search & applications
        properties or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could
        have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
        operations.  such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including
        general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made
        by google.  our services agreement with google requires that we comply with
        certain guidelines promulgated by google for the use of its brands and services,
        including the manner in which google\u2019s paid listings are displayed within
        search results, and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities
        of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner
        in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display
        paid listings.  subject to certain limitations, google may unilaterally update
        its policies and guidelines, which could in turn require modifications to,
        or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or
        business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an
        adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  noncompliance
        with google\u2019s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we syndicate
        paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our
        applications could, if not cured, result in google\u2019s suspension of some
        or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party
        partners, the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate
        paid listings or the termination of the services agreement by google.the termination
        of the services agreement by google, the curtailment of iac\u2019s rights
        under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) or
        the failure of google to perform its obligations under the agreement would
        have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
        operations.  in addition, our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement
        with google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the
        expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business,
        financial condition and results of operations.  if any of these events were
        to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings
        provider (or if an alternate provider were found, the economic and other terms
        of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative
        to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, google) or otherwise
        replace the lost revenues.general economic events or trends that reduce advertising
        spending could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.a
        substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to online
        advertising.  accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends
        that could result in decreased advertising expenditures.  advertising expenditures
        have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions
        and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence
        and discretionary spending.small and local businesses with which we do business
        are particularly sensitive to these events and trends, given that they are
        not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger
        competitors, which are generally better capitalized and have greater access
        to credit.  in the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and
        if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases
        and/or delays in advertising expenditures, which would reduce our revenues
        and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.our
        success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising,
        particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline
        advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet.we continue to
        compete with traditional advertising media, including television, radio and
        print, in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic
        and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures
        and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional
        offline media companies enter the online advertising market.  we believe that
        the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend,
        to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related
        advertising models (particularly in the case of models that incorporate user
        targeting and/or utilize mobile devices), the continued growth in commercial
        use of the internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which web browsers,
        software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising
        from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry
        is able to effectively manage click fraud.  any lack of growth in the market
        for online advertising, particularly for paid listings, or any decrease in
        the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to the passage
        of laws requiring additional disclosure, an industry-wide move to self regulatory
        11table of contentsprinciples that required additional disclosure  and/or
        opt-in policies for advertising that incorporates user targeting or other
        developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
        and results of operations.  we depend, in part, upon arrangements with third
        parties to drive traffic to our various websites and distribute our products
        and services.we engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic
        to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers.  how
        successful we are in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability
        to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various
        websites, as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products
        and services that resonate with users and customers generally.for example,
        we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to
        distribute search & applications search boxes, toolbars and other applications
        to users through third parties.  most of these agreements are either non\u2011exclusive
        and short\u2011term in nature or, in the case of long\u2011term or exclusive
        agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances.  in
        addition, a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage
        of the revenue generated by our b2b applications.  our inability to enter
        into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute our search boxes, toolbars
        and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in
        decreases in website traffic, queries and advertising revenue, which could
        have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
        operations.in addition, in the case of the businesses within our match segment,
        we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive
        traffic to our online personals websites.  pursuant to these arrangements,
        third parties generally promote our services on their websites or through
        e-mail campaigns and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites
        click through to (or register with) our online personals websites or pay a
        percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription
        fees.  these arrangements are generally not exclusive, are short\u2011term
        in nature and are generally terminable by either party given notice.  if existing
        arrangements with third parties are terminated (or are not renewed upon their
        expiration) and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues, or if
        we are unable to enter into new arrangements with existing and/or new third
        parties in response to industry trends, our business, financial condition
        and results of operations could be adversely affected.in the case of our homeadvisor
        business, our ability to drive traffic depends, in part, on the nature and
        number of home services professionals who are members of our network.  while
        these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate
        in accordance with our terms and conditions, we do not enter into long\u2011term
        agreements with them generally and subscription memberships may be canceled
        at any time.  in addition, a significant number of our home services professionals
        are sole proprietorships and small businesses, which are particularly sensitive
        to adverse economic conditions, such as constrained liquidity and decreases
        in consumer spending.  as a result, our network of home services professionals
        experiences turnover from time to time.  this turnover, if significant or
        recurring over a prolonged period, could result in a decrease in traffic to
        homeadvisor.com and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect our
        business, financial condition and results of operations.even if we succeed
        in driving traffic to our properties, we may not be able to convert this traffic
        or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality
        products and services.  for example, in the case of about.com, we rely on
        independent, freelance subject matter experts to generate quality content
        for our users.  if we fail to recruit and retain such experts generally and/or
        the experts ultimately retained cannot provide us with quality content in
        a cost-effective manner, the experience of our users would be adversely affected,
        which would result in a decrease in users and adversely affect our business,
        financial condition and results of operations.   in addition, we may not be
        able to adapt quickly and/or in cost-effective manner to frequent changes
        in user and customer preferences, which can be difficult to predict, or appropriately
        time the introduction of enhancements and/or new products or services to the
        market.  our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely
        affect user and customer experiences, which would result in decreases in users,
        customers and revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition
        and results of operations.as discussed below, our traffic building and conversion
        initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing,
        as well as for the development and introduction of new products, services
        and enhancements, infrastructure and other related efforts.marketing efforts
        designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or
        cost-effective.traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable
        expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing.  we have made,
        and expect to continue to make, significant expenditures for search engine
        marketing (primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords, which we purchase
        primarily through google), online display advertising and traditional 12table
        of contentsoffline advertising in connection with these initiatives, which
        may not be successful or cost-effective.  in the case of our search engine
        marketing efforts, our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent
        changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines, as well as
        changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising (which
        may be unilaterally updated by google), could adversely affect the placement
        of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase and the related
        user experience, as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising
        we purchase generally, which would increase our costs and adversely impact
        the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall.  in the case of paid
        advertising generally, the policies of sellers and publishers of advertising
        may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise
        some of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete
        effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition
        and results of operations.one of the most cost-effective efforts we employ
        to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, users and customers is commonly
        referred to as search engine optimization, or seo.  seo involves developing
        websites to rank well within search engine results.  search engines frequently
        update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results
        of user searches.  the failure to successfully manage seo efforts across our
        businesses, including the timely modification of seo efforts from time to
        time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms, search query
        trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure
        the display of unique offerings in search results (which actions by search
        service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less
        prominently within search engine results), could result in a substantial decrease
        in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were
        to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our
        business, financial condition and results of operations.in addition, search
        engines have increasingly expanded their offerings into other, non-search
        related categories, and have in certain instances displayed their own integrated
        or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those
        of third parties within their search engine results.  continued expansion
        and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease
        in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were
        to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our
        business, financial condition and results of operations.lastly, as discussed
        above, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort
        to increase traffic, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective
        than traditional marketing efforts.  if we are unable to renew existing (and
        enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as
        a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.any failure to attract
        and acquire new, and retain existing, traffic, users and customers in a cost-effective
        manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
        of operations.our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and
        enhance our various brands.through our various businesses, we own and operate
        a number of highly-recognizable brands with strong brand appeal within their
        respective industries.  we believe that our success depends, in part, upon
        our continuing ability to maintain and enhance these brands.  our brands could
        be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including product and service
        quality concerns, consumer complaints, actions brought by consumers, governmental
        or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and
        security breaches.  moreover, the failure to market our products and services
        successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), the inability to develop and
        introduce products and services that resonate with consumers and/or the inability
        to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost effective manner) to evolving changes
        in the internet and related technologies, applications and devices, could
        adversely impact our various brands, and in turn, our business, financial
        condition and results of operations.the internet and related technologies
        and applications continue to evolve and we may not be able to adapt to these
        changes.the development of new products and services in response to the evolving
        trends and technologies of the internet, as well as the identification of
        new business opportunities in this dynamic environment, requires significant
        time and resources.  we may not be able to adapt quickly enough (and/or in
        a cost-effective manner) to these changes, appropriately time the introduction
        of new products and services to the market or identify new business opportunities
        in a timely manner.  also, these changes could require us to modify related
        infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites,
        applications, services and proprietary technologies obsolete.  our failure
        to respond to any of these changes appropriately (and/or in a cost effective
        manner) could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
        of operations.in the case of certain of our applications, third parties have
        introduced (and continue to introduce) new or updated technologies, applications
        and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize
        these applications generally or otherwise make users less likely to use these
        services (such as through the introduction of features and/or processes that
        disproportionately and adversely impact the ability of consumers to access
        and use these services relative to those of our 13table of contentscompetitors).  for
        example, third parties continue to introduce technologies and applications
        (including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems) that may limit
        or prevent certain types of applications from being installed and/or have
        features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users
        will install our applications or that previously installed applications will
        remain in active use.  in addition, there are technologies and applications
        that interfere with the functionality of (or settings changes made by) our
        applications.  for example, there are technologies and applications that interfere
        with search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home
        page and web browser search settings previously selected by our users.  these
        technologies, applications and policies adversely impact our ability to generate
        search queries through our applications, which in turn adversely impacts our
        revenues.  technologies have also been introduced that can block the display
        of advertisements on web pages and that provide users with the ability to
        opt out of our advertising products.  our failure to successfully modify our
        toolbars and other applications in a cost-effective manner in response to
        the introduction and adoption of these new technologies and applications could
        adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  our
        success also depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile
        versions of our products and services.  while most of our users currently
        access our products and services through personal computers, users of (and
        usage volumes on) mobile devices, including tablets, continue to increase
        relative to those of personal computers.  while we have developed mobile versions
        of certain of our products and services and intend to continue to do so in
        the future, we have limited experience with mobile applications, both in terms
        of development and monetization.  moreover, mobile versions of our products
        and services that we develop may not be compelling to users and/advertisers.  even
        if we are able to develop mobile applications that resonate with users and
        advertisers, the success of these applications is dependent on their interoperability
        with various mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards
        that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise
        the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely
        impact usage of our products and  services on mobile devices and, in turn,
        our ability to attract advertisers.  lastly, as the adoption of mobile devices
        becomes more widespread, the usage of certain of our products and services
        may not translate to mobile devices, which shift could adversely affect our
        business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to
        replace the related revenues.the processing, storage, use and disclosure of
        personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation,
        conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.we
        receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other
        user data (including credit card data) in connection with the processing of
        search queries, the provision of online products and services, transactions
        with users and customers and advertising on our websites.\u00a0 the sharing,
        use, disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective
        privacy and data security policies of our various businesses.  these policies
        are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations,
        as well as evolving industry standards and practices, regarding privacy and
        the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal information
        and user data (for example, various state regulations concerning minimum data
        security standards, industry self-regulating principles that become standard
        practice and more stringent contractual protections regarding privacy and
        data security (and related compliance obligations)).\u00a0 in addition, if
        an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy, it could
        become subject to an investigation and proceeding for unfair or deceptive
        practices brought by the u.s. federal trade commission under the federal trade
        commission act (and/or brought by a state attorney general pursuant to a similar
        state law), as well as a private lawsuit under various u.s. federal and state
        laws.  in general, personal information is increasingly subject to legislation
        and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which
        is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed
        and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.      u.s. legislators
        and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data
        security.  in february 2012, the white house released a proposed consumer
        privacy bill of rights, which is intended to serve as a framework for new
        privacy legislation.  in march 2012, the u.s. federal trade commission released
        a staff report making recommendations for businesses and policy makers in
        the area of consumer privacy.  similarly, new privacy laws and regulations
        at the state level, as well as new laws and directives abroad (particularly
        in europe), are being proposed and implemented.  for example, new legislation
        in the state of california that became effective on january 1, 2014 requires
        companies that collect personal information to disclose how they respond to
        web browser \"do not track\" signals.   in addition, existing privacy laws
        that were intended for brick-and-mortar businesses could be interpreted in
        a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses.   new laws and regulations
        (or new interpretations of existing laws) in this area may make it more costly
        to operate our businesses and/or limit our ability to engage in certain types
        of activities, such as targeted advertising, which could adversely affect
        our business, financial condition and results of operations.  14table of contentsas
        privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also
        become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on
        the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses.\u00a0
        also, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security
        breaches.\u00a0 in the case of security breaches involving personal credit
        card data, credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments
        and impose fines for failure to comply with payment card industry (pci) data
        security standards.\u00a0 moreover, any such breach could decrease consumer
        confidence in the case of the business that experienced the breach or our
        businesses generally, which would decrease traffic to (and in turn, usage
        and transactions on) the relevant website and/or our various websites and
        which in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and
        results of operations.  the failure of any of our businesses, or their various
        third party vendors and service providers, to comply with applicable privacy
        policies, federal, state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or pci standards
        and/or the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data
        for any reason could adversely affect our business, financial condition and
        results of operations.our estimated income taxes could be materially different
        from income taxes that we ultimately pay.we are subject to income taxes in
        both the united states and numerous jurisdictions abroad.  significant judgment
        and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and
        related matters.  in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions
        and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise
        subject to interpretation.  our determination of our income tax liability
        is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently
        subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions.  although we believe our income
        tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant
        taxing authorities may disagree.  the ultimate outcome of any such audits
        and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations
        reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  any adverse
        outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial
        condition and results of operations.we may not be able to identify suitable
        acquisition candidates and even if we are able to do so, we may experience
        operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.  in addition,
        some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations
        or experience impairment of carrying value.we have made numerous acquisitions
        in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates
        that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as
        well as maximize our existing assets.  as a result, our future growth may
        depend, in part, on acquisitions.  we may not be able to identify suitable
        acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or
        other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection
        with our acquisition-related efforts.even if we identify what we believe to
        be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms, we may
        experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions,
        and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need
        to:\u2022successfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting,
        financial controls, management information, technology, human resources and
        other administrative systems, of acquired businesses with our existing operations
        and systems;\u2022successfully identify and realize potential synergies among
        acquired and existing businesses;\u2022retain or hire senior management and
        other key personnel at acquired businesses; and\u2022successfully manage acquisition\u2011related
        strain on the management, operations and financial resources of iac and its
        businesses and/or acquired businesses.we may not be successful in addressing
        these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical
        and future acquisitions.  in addition, the anticipated benefits of one or
        more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result
        in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities
        and the assumption of contingent liabilities.  also, the value of goodwill
        and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing
        unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment
        charges.  the occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect
        on our business, financial condition and results of operations.15table of
        contentswe operate in various international markets, some in which we have
        limited experience.  as a result, we face additional risks in connection with
        our international operations.  also, we may not be able to successfully expand
        into new, or further into our existing, international markets.we currently
        operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international
        presence.  in order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to
        achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the internet
        must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced
        in the united states.  moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our
        products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions,
        which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our
        international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition
        and results of operations.operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions
        where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks.  for example,
        we may experience difficulties in managing international operations due to
        distance, language and cultural differences, including issues associated with
        the establishment of management systems and infrastructures (including disclosure
        controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting), the
        staffing of foreign operations, exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy
        and protection of personal information.  our success in international markets
        will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition
        candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements
        with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses
        and operations with our own.a variety of new laws, or new interpretations
        of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.we
        are subject to a variety of laws in the u.s. and abroad that are costly to
        comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management
        time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies.\u00a0 some
        of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value\u2011added and other tax
        laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally
        and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged.\u00a0
        many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related
        technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues
        of the internet and related technologies.\u00a0 laws that do reference the
        internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and
        scope remain uncertain.\u00a0 for example, through our various businesses
        we post and link to third party content, including third party advertisements,
        links and websites.  we also allow users to submit content, such as comments,
        photographs and videos.  we could be subject to liability for posting, hosting
        or linking to third party content, and while we generally require third parties
        to indemnify us for related claims, we may not be able to enforce our indemnification
        rights.  some laws, including the communications decency act, or cda, and
        the digital millennium copyright act, or dmca, limit our liability for posting
        or linking to third party content.  for example, the dmca generally protects
        online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on the
        storage of third party content at the direction of the user, so long as certain
        statutory requirements are satisfied.  however, the scope and applicability
        of the dmca are subject to judicial interpretation and, as such, remain uncertain,
        and the u.s. congress may enact legislation affecting (and potentially limiting)
        the protections afforded by the dmca to online service providers.  moreover,
        similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various
        businesses operate.  as a result, claims have been, and could be, threatened
        and filed under both u.s. and foreign laws based upon use of third party content
        asserting, among other things, negligence, defamation, invasion of privacy
        or right or publicity, copyright infringement or trademark infringement. in
        addition, changing internet business practices may attract increased legal
        and regulatory attention.\u00a0 one example of such changing practices is
        the advent of so-called \u201cnative\u201d advertising, a form of advertising
        in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as
        similar to traditional editorial content.\u00a0 the u.s. federal trade commission
        recently indicated that it will be monitoring the use of online native advertising
        to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive
        to consumers.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any failure on our part to comply with
        applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely
        affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u00a0
        in addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or
        interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted,
        our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws,
        which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our
        products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers.\u00a0
        specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will
        take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities. while
        we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable
        law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will
        not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely
        affect us.  any events of this nature could adversely affect our business,
        financial condition and results of operations.16table of contentswe may fail
        to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of
        infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.we regard our
        intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets,
        patents, copyrights and other similar intellectual property, as critical to
        our success.\u00a0 for example, the businesses within our principal reporting
        segments (search & applications, match and local) rely heavily upon their
        trademarks (primarily ask.com, about.com, dictionary.com, our various toolbar
        brands, match.com, okcupid.com, ourtime.com, meetic.com and homeadvisor.com
        and related domain names and logos), through which they market their products
        and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition.\u00a0
        so long as these businesses continue to use these trademarks to identify their
        products and services and renew trademark registrations as required, they
        will continue to enjoy trademark protection indefinitely under current laws,
        rules and regulations.the businesses within our search & applications segment
        also rely upon trade secrets, including algorithms for the generation, organization
        and presentation of search results.\u00a0 to a lesser extent, these businesses
        also rely upon patented and patent\u2011pending proprietary technologies and
        processes, primarily those relating to search\u2011related products and services,
        with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2033,
        and copyrighted material, primarily emoticons, characters and other content
        that is incorporated into (and used in connection with the marketing of) toolbars
        generally.our match segment also relies upon trade secrets and certain patent\u2011pending
        proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related
        features, products and services.\u00a0 homeadvisor relies heavily upon trade
        secrets, primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network
        of home services professionals are matched with consumers, as well as related
        patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020.we rely on a combination
        of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers,
        affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property
        rights.\u00a0 for example, we have generally registered and continue to apply
        to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks
        and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and
        renew domain names as we deem appropriate.\u00a0 effective trademark protection
        may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products
        and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use
        of marks governed by private contract.\u00a0 similarly, not every variation
        of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.we also
        generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections
        as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances,
        and will continue to do so in the future.\u00a0 no assurances can be given
        that any patent application we have filed (or will file) will result in a
        patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate
        protection against competitors and similar technologies.\u00a0 in addition,
        no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products
        or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we
        own.despite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not
        be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could
        arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual
        property without authorization.\u00a0 the occurrence of any of these events
        could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to
        control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names,
        as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with
        similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial
        condition and results of operations.from time to time, we have been subject
        to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including
        claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other
        intellectual property rights held by third parties.\u00a0 in addition, litigation
        may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights,
        protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary
        rights claimed by others.\u00a0 any litigation of this nature, regardless
        of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management
        and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business,
        financial condition and results of operations.\u00a0 patent litigation tends
        to be particularly protracted and expensive.our success depends, in part,
        on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties.  system
        interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third
        party information systems may affect our business.to succeed, our systems
        and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis. from time to
        time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or
        all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products
        and services, which could adversely affect our business. moreover, as traffic
        to our websites, applications 17table of contentsand online properties increases
        and the number of new (and presumably more complex) products and services
        that we introduce continues to grow, we will need to upgrade our systems,
        infrastructures and technologies generally to facilitate this growth. if we
        fail to do so, users, customers and third parties with whom we do business
        may not be able to access our products and services on an intermittent or
        prolonged basis, which could adversely affect the quality of their experiences.  in
        addition, we could experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in
        connection with these efforts, which could have the same effect. moreover,
        even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies and/or operational failures
        in connection with these efforts, third parties with whom we do business may
        not make the changes to their systems, infrastructures and technologies needed
        to access our products and services on a timely basis, if at all. the occurrence
        of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition
        and results of operations.we also rely on third party computer systems, data
        centers, broadband and other communications systems and service providers
        in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as
        well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and
        customers. any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of
        our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of these systems,
        could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process
        certain transactions with users and customers.  furthermore, data security
        breaches (as a result of actions taken by hackers or otherwise), fire, power
        loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism,
        acts of god and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt
        computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time. any
        event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of
        critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers.
        while we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations,
        our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not
        sufficient for all eventualities. in addition, we may not have adequate insurance
        coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.in particular,
        our destination search websites may be adversely affected by fraudulent, surreptitious
        or other unwanted computer programs, applications and activity that make changes
        to users'' computers and interfere with the overall experience of our products
        and services, such as by hijacking queries to these websites or altering or
        replacing search results generated. this type of interference often occurs
        without disclosure to (or consent from) users, resulting in a negative experience
        that users may associate with us. these disruptive programs and applications
        may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable, may reinstall themselves
        and may circumvent efforts to block or remove them.in addition, downloadable
        applications through which we provide search services are also subject to
        attack by viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, which could
        jeopardize the security of information stored in users'' computers or in our
        systems and networks. no assurances can be given that our efforts to combat
        these malicious applications will be successful and/or that our products and
        services will not have (or will not be perceived to have) vulnerabilities
        in this regard.if any of these events were to occur, it could damage our reputation
        and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers, which
        could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results

        including risks specific to our deployments with our television service provider
        customers.our industryevolution of advanced television services. tivo revolutionized
        television viewing when it introduced the dvr, allowing consumers to enjoy
        an on-demand experience. since then, dvr adoption has grown rapidly and consumers
        have come to expect a great deal of flexibility and convenience in their consumption
        of entertainment. our dvr products proved that the television entertainment
        experience could be significantly improved by removing the limitations of
        linear, appointment based viewing.\u00a0the emergence of vod and content options
        delivered through cable and broadband connections (or so called over-the-top
        content (ott)) is once again revolutionizing the way people consume video
        entertainment. the rapid growth of broadband video means a virtually infinite
        world of content choices now exists along with much greater convenience in
        how and when that content is viewed. the rapid proliferation of content requires
        a solution to effectively suggest, search, navigate, and access the growing
        volume of broadcast, cable, and vod from the internet and cable providers
        including television shows, movies, user generated videos, music, and other
        personal content including photos and home videos. in addition, proliferation
        of new consumption devices like tablets and entertainment-oriented smartphones
        creates additional demand for solutions that enable viewing when and where
        convenient for the user across multiple screens.advanced television technology
        as a competitive asset. virtually all of the major television service providers
        in the united states are offering dvr technology to their customers. in addition,
        some are developing strategies to address (albeit in very diverse ways) the
        proliferation of broadband video and alternate devices such as tablet devices
        and tv everywhere. some of these companies have indicated they consider such
        services a competitive tool to help differentiate their pay television services
        by offering their customers more programming features. we believe that the
        combination of our award winning, easy-to-use interface and famous brand,
        hosted services, and customized advanced television solutions can make the
        advantages of this advanced tv technology available to the large number of
        operators who cannot afford to develop these technologies in house.the changing
        television advertising & audience measurement industry. the decline of live
        linear television viewing, which is now only approximately 40% of viewing
        on the tivo platform, along with the proliferation of additional content choices
        is requiring television advertisers to evaluate new and different ways to
        reach consumers and measure their interactions with content and advertising.
        the dvr\u00a0and other new consumer electronic devices which access broadband
        video have given viewers the freedom to view content when they want; and this
        time shifting has made it more difficult for advertisers to be assured that
        their commercials will be viewed by audiences at the regularly scheduled time
        the program is aired by network or local television stations. dvrs, in particular,
        allow viewers the freedom to fast-forward through all or a portion of commercial
        advertising incorporated into television and other programs, which means that
        advertisers are not assured that their commercials will be viewed at all.
        tivo offers other programming options, such as video delivered by broadband
        to the television, which may result in further audience fragmentation.\u00a0in
        addition, subject to its privacy policy and applicable laws, tivo collects
        data from its own and third-party set-top boxes that allows it to measure
        the viewing of television programs and commercials in a manner that we believe
        is significantly more accurate and insightful than the traditional approach
        to television measurement practiced by companies like nielsen media. this
        traditional approach is gradually being supplemented by additional alternate
        forms of measurement which we are uniquely positioned to provide. tivo uses
        second-by-second viewing data from a large national sample of our set-top
        boxes to create highly detailed statistics which are not subject to the limitations
        of nielsen''s minute by minute approach and program-based ratings.7our strategywe
        believe we have created a unique set of technologies, products, and services
        that meet the needs of consumers, television service providers, and the advertising
        community. our goal is to change the way consumers access and watch linear
        television, on-demand television, and broadband video by offering a best in
        class user experience and search and discovery services to generate revenue
        through the licensing of both our tivo branded services and technology and
        non-branded services and technology delivered by digitalsmiths to television
        viewing households worldwide.provide compelling, easy-to-use consumer offering.
        our advanced television solutions have an easy, intuitive user interface and
        many features that we believe dramatically improve a consumer''s television
        viewing experience. our advanced television solutions can support linear television
        delivered through analog cable, digital cable, satellite, from the cloud,
        or over-the-air, television service provider vod, and broadband video. our
        technology enables consumers to find and watch their favorite content, whether
        it is on tv, vod, or broadband, and helps them discover new programming through
        features that search and browse for content by subject, title, genre, actor,
        director, or channel, enjoy access to extra content via broadband and comprehensive
        episode guides, as well as suggesting programs that consumers may like through
        a variety of tivo recommendation features.\u00a0offer increasingly differentiated
        features and services. our goal is to lead the market with innovations that
        expand the value and potential of our advanced television services. we plan
        to continue to invest significant resources in innovation to improve consumer
        choice, convenience, and control over their home entertainment and to make
        our services more compelling for both current and potential customers. for
        example, we have launched tivo products and applications for android-enabled
        smart phones and tablets and ios-enabled smartphones and tablets that allow
        viewers to control their set-top boxes as well as, currently with respect
        to ios-enabled devices and in the future with respect to android-enabled devices,
        to consume video both inside and outside the home. we continue to update the
        tivo service with new audio and video applications such as spotify and hulu.
        these applications give consumers a much richer and more powerful way to explore
        all of the content available to them and expand the population of devices
        upon which we can deploy our services. we expect that a significant portion
        of our future product development efforts will be focused on broadband functionality,
        enabling the tivo experience on additional consumer device and screens, cloud-based
        services, personalization, and integration of new discovery paradigms like
        social network recommendations. develop solutions for television service providers.
        part of our strategy focuses on developing versions of the tivo service that
        can be deployed by third-parties (typically television service providers)
        in conjunction with tivo and third-party designed set-top boxes and other
        consumer electronic devices such as tablets in order to promote the mass deployment
        of devices utilizing our technology. for example, we are able to deliver a
        set-top box product to our television service provider customers that combines
        within one integrated user interface: on-demand viewing of linear broadcast
        television delivered by the television service provider through a built in
        dvr; access to on-demand viewing of a television service provider''s own vod
        service; and access to broadband delivered content (or so called over-the-top
        content). additionally, we believe our retail business uniquely positions
        us versus other vendors to license our technology to television service providers
        as we understand consumer behavior first-hand and are able to innovate at
        a faster pace. it allows us to leverage our research and development across
        our direct to consumer products as well as our products and services provided
        to television service providers. extend tivo products beyond the u.s. market.
        we also believe there is a large opportunity to deploy the tivo service and
        technology outside the united states. for example, in the united kingdom,
        virgin media (virgin), the united kingdom''s largest cable operator, recently
        connected its two millionth tivo customer. to date, we have mso subscriptions
        to the tivo service in the geographies of australia, mexico, new zealand,
        spain, sweden, and taiwan as well.our solutions have the ability to integrate
        broadband offerings for cable, satellite, and over-the-air television service
        providers and our strategy is to sign additional international partnerships
        and distribution agreements in the future. typically, the parties distributing
        the tivo service under these agreements are subject to significant deployment
        and marketing commitments.extend the tivo service to the cloud. tivo has been
        transitioning its service to the cloud over the past several years, and allowing
        tivo to offer its products on a multitude of devices beyond the set-top box.
        further, tivo is in the process of developing a network dvr service, which
        will allow pay tv to offer storage in the cloud reducing their expenditures
        on hardware, allowing recorded shows to be delivered to more devices, and
        enabling features and controls for both consumers and operators that weren\u2019t
        possible with a set-top box based dvr. additionally, the recent acquisition
        of digitalsmiths enables tivo to offer elements of its service through non-tivo
        branded user experiences.8extend and protect our intellectual property. the
        convenience, control, and ease of use of the tivo service is derived largely
        from the technology we have developed. we have adopted a proactive patent
        and trademark strategy designed to protect and extend our technology and intellectual
        property. we have filed patent applications relating to numerous inventions
        resulting from tivo research and development, including many critical aspects
        of the design, functionality, and operation of tivo products and services
        as well as technology that we may incorporate in future products and services.
        we have engaged in significant intellectual property litigation with certain
        television service and technology providers in the united states to protect
        our technology from infringement. to date, we have received cash and future
        technology revenue payment commitments totaling over $1.6 billion from intellectual
        property litigation. generate revenue from advertising and audience research
        capabilities. we offer interactive advertising capabilities to advertisers,
        advertising agencies, and broadcast networks. our advertising products include
        detailed anonymous aggregated reporting on actual viewing and screen-by-screen
        interaction by consumers. we offer our advertisers compelling interactive
        products such as branded long-form videos (showcases) that can include requests
        for information and customizable applications. we also offer the ability to
        enhance existing television commercials with interactive tags, enabling consumers
        to pause television and explore additional advertising content. we plan to
        continue to develop and enhance our interactive advertising capabilities in
        the future to generate additional revenues as well as provide us with additional
        information to help us improve and enhance the tivo service for our customers.\u00a0we
        also offer audience research and measurement products through our subsidiary,
        tivo research and analytics, inc. (tra), whose customers include advertisers,
        agencies, and broadcast and cable networks. these customers use tra''s software
        and advanced data analytics which match tv tuning and purchase data in order
        to optimize advertising to the right audience. we believe this creates ad
        placement efficiency, drives more product sales for brands, and a higher return
        on media investment for advertisers while increasing advertising revenues
        for networks. we plan to continue to develop and enhance our measurement capabilities
        to generate additional revenues and provide additional innovative solutions,
        such as crossmedia measurement products.our technologywe have developed a
        technology portfolio that makes the tivo service available on a standalone
        retail dvr product line that is capable of receiving over-the-air digital
        signals, analog cable, digital cable through the use of cablecardstm, and
        from broadband video sources. the tivo service is also deployed directly by
        u.s. satellite and cable operators such as directv, grande, rcn, suddenlink,
        gci, mediacom, midcontinent communications (midco), cableone, atlantic broadband
        (abb) and others and internationally, such as with virgin , ono, and com hem.
        our strategy is to sign additional distribution agreements to make the tivo
        service available on additional set-top boxes and other devices such as tablets
        or computers and in the future connected televisions and game consoles. we
        believe that our commitment to research and development will allow us to continue
        to innovate new products for our customers, even while we continue to focus
        on managing and reducing our overall research and development expenses from
        fiscal year 2014. tivo''s technology for enabling the tivo service includes:
        the tivo service client software platform, the tivo service infrastructure,
        and tivo-enabled hardware designs.tivo service client software. the tivo service
        client software functions on set-top boxes, tablets, and mobile devices which
        run the tivo software. we have enhanced the client software to support multiple
        services and applications, such as receipt of broadband video content, digital
        music, and photos. the tivo client software manages interaction with the tivo
        service infrastructure in the cloud. after the initial set-up of the tivo
        service, the tivo-enabled set-top box will automatically connect to the tivo
        service infrastructure over broadband connection to download the program guide
        data, client software upgrades, advertising content, and other broadband content.
        we have also enabled the tivo service client software to operate on certain
        commonly used integrated third-party set-top boxes, such as on a cisco, samsung,
        and pace manufactured set-top boxes.tivo service infrastructure. the tivo
        service infrastructure operates the tivo service, managing the distribution
        of proprietary services, and specialized content such as program guide data,
        interactive advertising, and tivo client software upgrades. it interfaces
        with our billing and customer support systems for service authorization and
        bug tracking, among other activities. in addition, the tivo service infrastructure
        collects anonymous viewing information uploaded from tivo-enabled set-top
        boxes for use in recommendations and personalization, and our audience research
        measurement efforts. the infrastructure has also been designed to work with
        the networks of service provider customers.tivo-enabled hardware design. the
        tivo-enabled hardware designs, including our latest tivo roamio line up of
        dvrs and tivo mini non-dvr set-top-boxes, are specifications developed by
        tivo for set-top boxes and other 9devices. we provide this design to our contract
        manufacturer that produces tivo-branded hardware. the tivo-enabled hardware
        design includes a modular front-end that allows the basic platform to be used
        for digital and analog broadcast, digital and analog cable, broadband and
        in some cases vod. in addition, the tivo-enabled hardware design allows for
        connection to broadband networks and external devices to enable existing and
        future services. we believe that the tivo-enabled hardware design and our
        lack of dependence on third-party hardware design, which can delay time to
        market, allows us to innovate our client software at a faster pace. significant
        relationshipsdirectv. directv is the largest provider of satellite television
        in the u.s. we have had a longstanding relationship with directv from 1999
        to the present to provide the tivo service to directv''s customer base. as
        of january 31, 2014, directv was our largest mso customer by revenue, but
        no longer represents a meaningful portion of our 3.2 million mso subscription
        base. historically, directv has paid us a recurring monthly per-household
        fee for access to the technology needed to provide its customers the tivo
        service subject to an aggregate minimum monthly amount. however, due to the
        decline in the number of directv mso subscriptions in recent years, in fiscal
        year 2014, we recognized the monthly minimum amount each month during the
        entire year. we incur limited recurring expenses related to the directv relationship.
        on september\u00a03, 2008, we extended our agreement with directv. the fees
        paid by directv are subject to monthly minimum payments that escalate during
        the term of the agreement (which expires on february 15, 2015, unless extended
        until february 15, 2018 by directv) and the revenues from directv are material
        to tivo''s net income.customer service and supportfor our tivo-owned service,
        we provide customer support through outsourced service providers as well as
        our internal customer service personnel. in most cases, when our product is
        distributed through a television service provider (such as directv, grande,
        ono, rcn, suddenlink, gci, and virgin) the service provider is primarily responsible
        for customer support. we may provide training and other assistance to these
        service providers.individual customers have access to an internet-based repository
        for technical information and troubleshooting techniques. they also can obtain
        support through other means such as the tivo website, web forums, email, and
        telephone support.we offer a manufacturer\u2019s warranty of 90 days for labor
        and one year for parts on the dvrs tivo manufacturers which enable our tivo-owned
        subscriptions. we contract with third-parties to handle warranty repair. warranties
        provided to service providers who distribute tivo hardware vary in length
        depending on the pricing paid by the buyer.research and product developmentour
        research and development efforts are focused on designing and developing the
        elements necessary to enable the tivo service. these activities include hardware
        and software development.\u00a0\u00a0fiscal\u00a0year\u00a0ended\u00a0january\u00a031,\u00a0201420132012\u00a0(in
        millions)research and development expenses$106.9$115.1$110.4we decreased the
        number of our regular, temporary, and part-time employees engaged in research
        and development between january\u00a031, 2013 and january\u00a031, 2014 as
        we were able to release a number of products last fiscal year and continued
        to focus on efficiency in our research and development expenditures. in the
        fiscal year ending january 31, 2015, we currently expect our research and
        development expense to decrease from fiscal year 2014 levels as we benefit
        from a full year of efficiencies gained in the fiscal year ended january 31,
        2014 and continue to focus on incremental research and development spend efficiencies.manufacturing
        and supply chainwe outsource the manufacturing of our products to third-party
        manufacturers. this outsourcing extends from prototyping to volume manufacturing
        and includes activities such as material procurement, final assembly, test,
        quality control, and shipment to distribution centers. today the majority
        of our products are assembled in mexico, with the majority of our components
        delivered from manufacturers overseas. our primary distribution center is
        operated on an outsourced basis in texas.10the components that make up our
        products are purchased from various vendors, including key suppliers such
        as broadcom, which supplies system controllers. some of our components, including
        system controllers, chassis, remote controls, and certain discrete components
        are currently supplied by sole source suppliers. our dependence on these sole
        source suppliers could expose us to the risk of supply shortages, unexpected
        price increases, and increased compliance risks with new conflict mineral
        requirements in the future.we often require substantial lead time to purchase
        components and manufacture anticipated quantities of devices that enable the
        tivo service. this long lead time requires us to make component purchasing
        and inventory decisions well in advance of our peak selling periods. we offer
        our individual end-users who purchase from tivo.com a 30-day money back guarantee.
        we typically do not offer a right of return or significant extended payment
        terms to our retailers.seasonalitysales of our tivo-owned devices and subscriptions
        to the tivo service are affected by seasonality. thus, we generate a significant
        number of our annual device sales and new tivo-owned subscriptions during
        and immediately after the holiday shopping season with associated increases
        in revenue. we also incur significant increases in expenses in the second
        half of the year related to hardware costs, revenue share and other payments
        to channel, and sales and marketing, subscription acquisition costs in anticipation
        of the holiday shopping season. there is less seasonality associated with
        our mso customers.competitionwe believe that the principal competitive factors
        in the advanced television market, which includes dvrs and other broadband
        enabled consumer electronic devices, are brand recognition and awareness,
        functionality, ease of use, content availability, and pricing. we currently
        see two primary categories of competitors for the tivo-owned channel: dvrs
        offered by satellite, cable, and telecommunications operators and advanced
        television products offered by consumer electronics and software companies.competition
        in the tivo-owned subscription business. our retail products compete in the
        united states against services sold directly by cable, telecommunications,
        and satellite operators. these products typically combine pay television reception
        with dvr functionality; most of these products include multiple tuners, high
        definition recording, and in some cases multi-room viewing capability. some
        of these products are offered at lower prices but in many cases are bundled
        with other services provided by the operator and the price for the dvr and
        dvr service may not be apparent to the consumer. in addition, these products
        are usually professionally installed and may appeal to consumers who do not
        pro-actively select a dvr service. additionally, many u.s. cable operators
        are currently deploying vod technology, which over time could serve as a substitute
        to our retail products. we are aware of at least one u.s. cable operator,
        cablevision, inc., which is deploying remote storage-based dvr products. to
        the extent that cable operators offer regular television programming as part
        of their server-based vod offerings and dvr technology, consumers may prefer
        not to acquire an independent set-top based dvr through retail channels.our
        retail products also compete against products with on-demand internet-enabled
        services offered by consumer electronics companies including:\u2022personal
        computers: microsoft based pcs and apple products (among others) enable a
        variety of entertainment features and services which offer alternatives to
        traditional dvr services, primarily via internet delivery of content.\u2022broadband
        capable devices and game consoles: we are seeing a proliferation of broadband
        enabled devices, such as connected televisions, \u201csmartphones\u201d, single
        purpose broadband set-top boxes, tablets, and gaming consoles that offer broadband
        delivered content. though these devices do not offer the breadth of the tivo
        service, they do offer alternative ways to access internet-delivered video
        content through devices that many consumers may seek to acquire for other
        purposes. for example, many consumer electronics companies have television
        or dvd products that are internet enabled and others have built dedicated
        devices for accessing video over the internet such as appletv, roku, and googletv.
        similarly, companies such as sony and microsoft have now enabled the digital
        delivery of video programming over the internet to their game consoles.competition
        in our mso business. our mso revenues depend upon both our ability to successfully
        negotiate agreements with our service provider customers and, in turn, upon
        our customers\u2019 successful commercialization of their underlying products.
        we face competition from companies such as nds/cisco, ericsson (mediaroom),
        motorola/arris, and from mso internally developed solutions such as comcast
        x1, which have created competing products that provide user interface software
        for use on television set-top boxes and consumer electronic devices. 11such
        companies may offer more economically attractive agreements to service providers
        and consumer electronics manufacturers by bundling multiple products together.
        we also face competition from internal development initiatives at some large
        service providers and consumer electronics manufacturers who may choose to
        develop similar products on their own rather than resell products/services
        developed by tivo.competition in the advertising and research businesses.
        digital video recorder services, in general, and tivo, specifically, compete
        with other advertising media such as print, radio, television, vod, internet,
        and other emerging advertising platforms for a share of advertisers\u2019
        total advertising budgets. if advertisers do not perceive digital video recording
        services, in general, and tivo specifically, as an effective advertising medium,
        they may be reluctant to advertise on the tivo service. in addition, advertisers
        may not support or embrace the tivo technology due to a belief that our technology\u2019s
        ability to fast-forward through commercials will reduce the effectiveness
        of general television advertising. we compete with audience research companies
        such as nielsen, kantar media research, and rentrak for research spend from
        advertisers, advertising agencies, and television networks. patents and intellectual
        propertywe have filed patent applications relating to numerous inventions
        resulting from tivo research and development, including many critical aspects
        of the design, functionality, and operation of tivo products and services
        as well as technology that we may incorporate in future products and services.
        we have been awarded approximately 388 foreign and domestic patents and have
        approximately 358 foreign and domestic patent applications pending. for example,
        we own u.s. patent no. 6,233,389, titled \u201cmultimedia time warping system\u201d
        (referred to as the time warp patent or the ''389 patent) which describes
        an invention that allows an user to store selected television shows while
        the user is simultaneously watching or storing another program and expires
        in july 2018. the time warp patent has been through reexamination at the united
        states patent office twice and had its claims upheld without modification.
        the majority of our patents have expirations beyond 2018.  during the fiscal
        year ended january 31, 2014 we entered into a settlement and patent license
        agreement with arris group, inc. (arris) (owner of general instrument corporation,
        formerly a subsidiary of motorola mobility, inc.), cisco systems, inc. (cisco),
        and google inc. (google) (owner of motorola mobility, llc formerly motorola
        mobility, inc.), pursuant to which the parties agreed to settle and dismiss
        all outstanding litigation between them, including related litigation involving
        time warner cable (as described in tivo''s periodic reports filed with the
        securities and exchange commission ), provide licenses to certain patents
        between the parties, and release patent infringement claims between the parties
        with respect to all outstanding litigation in exchange for a payment of $490
        million to tivo by google and cisco in connection with the motorola/cisco
        settlement. during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2012, we entered into
        separate settlements of pending intellectual property lawsuits we had filed
        against dish and at&t inc. for $500 million and $215 million, respectively.
        during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2013 we entered into a settlement
        of pending intellectual property lawsuit against verizon for $250.4 million.
        to date, we have received cash and future technology revenue payment commitments
        totaling over $1.6 billion from intellectual property litigation. we have
        secured numerous foreign and domestic trademark registrations for our distinctive
        marks, including but not limited to registrations, for the marks \u201ctivo,\u201d
        the tivo logo, \u201cseason pass,\u201d thumbs logos, and certain sound marks.
        we anticipate ongoing progress in our establishment of a defensible and useful
        intellectual property portfolio; however, we cannot assure you that current
        patents will be enforceable or our current patent applications will ever be
        allowed or granted. see part i. item\u00a01a. risk factors under the headings

        was last updated in august 2013 to cover new features that we have introduced
        and plan to introduce in the future. among other things, this policy explains
        how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information.employeesas of february
        28, 2014, we employed approximately 626 full-time employees. we also employ,
        from time to time, a number of temporary and part-time employees as well as
        consultants on a contract basis. our future success will depend in part on
        our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate highly qualified employees.
        we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. our employees
        are not represented by a collective 12bargaining organization and we have

        you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as
        the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this offering
        memorandum before investing in the notes. any of the following risks could
        materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results
        of operations or prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our ability
        to repay our outstanding convertible senior notes and the trading price of
        our common stock. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to
        us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and
        adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.we
        have incurred significant net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability
        from our non-licensing businesses. we generate a significant amount of revenue
        from our patent settlement agreements with dish, at&t, verizon, motorola/cisco
        which expire in calendar year 2018 or later, and if we are unable to renew
        or replace these revenues, our business would be harmed.14table of contentsduring
        the fiscal years ended january 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, our net income (losses)
        were $271.8 million, $(5.3) million, and $102.2 million, respectively. as
        of january 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $(410.5) million. the
        size of future net losses or income will be impacted by a number of factors,
        including the timing of the development or deployment of solutions under our
        television service provider arrangements, the growth or decline in the number
        of tivo subscriptions, the prices at which we sell tivo set-top boxes, the
        amount of research and development expenses we incur to fund new product development
        and expand our engineering services capacity, and the amount and timing of
        settlement payments. in fiscal year 2012, we entered into patent settlement
        agreements with dish and at&t and in fiscal year 2013, we entered into a patent
        settlement agreement with verizon. in fiscal year 2014, we entered into a
        patent settlement agreement with motorola/cisco. the patent settlement agreements
        with dish, at&t, verizon, and motorola/cisco will generate recurring revenues
        for us until 2024, with the majority of these revenues received by 2019. we
        generate a significant amount of revenues as a result from these settlement
        agreements. if we are unable to renew or replace these revenues through similar
        or other business arrangements, our revenues would decline and our business
        would be harmed as a result. unless and until we generate significant additional
        revenues from our operations or substantially reduce our expenses, we may
        likely continue to incur losses in future fiscal years after we cease further
        receipt of our current legal settlement payments and we may never achieve
        sustained profitability. as such, in the future, continued net losses and
        negative cash flow could drain our existing cash balance.intellectual property
        claims against us could be extremely costly, result in the loss of significant
        rights, require us to alter our current product and business strategy and
        force us to cease operating our business, in which case our business would
        be harmed.from time to time, we are sued in court or receive letters from
        third-parties alleging that we are infringing on their intellectual property,
        including our current pending intellectual property litigation with digital
        cbt. regardless of their merit, we are forced to devote time and resources
        to respond to these lawsuits and letters. in addition, if any of these third-parties
        or others were to be successful in suing us, our business would be harmed
        because intellectual property litigation may:\u00a0\u2022be time-consuming
        and expensive;\u2022divert management''s attention and resources away from
        our business;\u2022cause delays in product delivery and new service introduction;\u2022cause
        the cancellation of current or future products or services;\u2022require us
        to pay significant amounts in damages, royalties and/or licensing fees;\u2022cause
        us to incur material expenses as a result of our indemnification obligations;
        and\u2022result in an injunction that could force us to limit the functionality
        of our products and services, stop importing our products and services into
        certain markets, or cease operating our business altogether.the emerging advanced-television
        industry is highly litigious. additionally, many patents covering interactive
        television technologies have been granted but have not been commercialized.
        a number of companies in the advanced-television industry earn substantial
        profits from technology licensing, and the introduction of new technologies
        by us is likely to provoke lawsuits from such companies. a successful claim
        of infringement against us, our inability to obtain an acceptable license
        from the holder of the patent or other right, or our inability to design around
        an asserted patent or other right could cause our manufacturers to cease manufacturing
        dvrs that enable the tivo service, our retailers to stop selling the product
        or us to cease providing our service, or all of the above, which would eliminate
        our ability to generate revenues.under our agreements with many of our manufacturing
        and licensing partners, we may be required to indemnify them in the event
        that our technology infringes upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties.
        due to indemnity obligations which include infringement of third-party intellectual
        property rights and may also include indemnification for open source software
        violations, we could be forced to incur material expenses if our manufacturing
        and licensing partners are sued. in addition, because the products sold by
        our manufacturing and licensing partners often involve the use of other persons''
        technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where
        there is a claim of infringement asserted against the product in question,
        even if the claim does not pertain to our technology.our success depends in
        part on our ability to secure and protect our patents, trademarks, and other
        proprietary rights.15table of contentsour success and ability to compete are
        substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology. we rely
        on patent, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, as well as
        confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, customers, partners,
        and others to protect our intellectual property rights. however, the steps
        we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate. we have filed
        patent applications and provisional patent applications covering much of the
        unique technology used to deliver the tivo service and its features and functionality.
        to date, several of these patents have been granted, but we cannot assure
        you that any additional patents will ever be granted, that any issued patents
        will protect our intellectual property or that third-parties will not challenge
        any issued patents. opposition proceedings may result in changes to certain
        claims or revocation of a patent. in addition, other parties may independently
        develop similar or competing technologies that design around any patents that
        may be issued to us. our failure to secure and protect our proprietary rights
        could harm our business.if cable operators were to cease supporting and providing
        cablecards to consumers or cable operators were to transmit television programs
        using technology that prevents our retail products from receiving and displaying
        television programs, the functionality of our current retail products would
        be severely limited, in which case our business would be harmed.the cable
        industry in the united states is currently required to provide access to digital
        high definition television signals through cablecard\u2122 technology. we
        rely on conditional access security cards supplied by cable operators called
        cablecards for certain types of our dvrs to receive encrypted digital television
        signals without a cable operator supplied set-top box. with the limited exception
        of high definition over the air broadcast channels, our dvrs presently are
        limited to using cablecards\u00a0to access digital cable, high definition,
        and premium cable channels (such as hbo) that are delivered in a linear fashion
        where all programs are broadcast to all subscribers all the time. our retail
        cable products are unable to access the encrypted digital television signals
        of satellite providers such as directv and dish as well as alternative television
        service providers such as at&t u-verse and google fiber.  and without cablecards,
        there presently is no alternative way for us to sell a retail cable product
        that works across cable systems nationwide.\u00a0 furthermore, to the extent
        more pay tv customers obtain television service from satellite television
        providers and alternative television providers such at&t u-verse and google
        fiber, the desirability of our retail products and service will be harmed.on
        january 15, 2013, the united states court of appeals for the d.c. circuit
        vacated rules concerning the technical standards for cablecards adopted by
        the federal communications commission (fcc) in 2003. these rules were part
        of an fcc order that echostar challenged regarding certain encoding rules
        applied to satellite operators. echostar did not challenge the technical standards
        for cablecards and the court did not address any element of the fcc order
        that applied only to cable systems, cable operators, and cable devices. on
        july 16, 2013, tivo filed a petition for rulemaking seeking reinstatement
        by the fcc of the vacated technical standards for cablecards. the national
        cable and telecommunications association has taken the position that rules
        adopted by the federal communications commission in 2010 that, among other
        things, require cable operators to support and supply cablecards to retail
        devices no longer apply and the cablecard rules should not be reinstated.
        the ncta has also been seeking legislation to repeal an fcc requirement that
        cable operators employ separable security (i.e. cablecards) in the set-top
        boxes they lease to their subscribers.if cable operators were to cease supporting
        and providing cablecards to consumers without providing tivo with a commercially
        viable alternative method of accessing digital cable, high definition, and
        premium cable channels that works across cable systems nationwide, we would
        be unable to sell most of our current retail products, may be unable to create
        future retail products, and our business would be harmed as the market for
        devices which only receive over the air broadcast television signals is significantly
        smaller than the current pay tv market.certain cable operators are deploying
        switched digital video technologies to transmit television programs in an
        on demand fashion (switched digital) only to subscribers who request to watch
        a particular program. although cable operators are deploying a solution to
        enable our customers to receive channels delivered with switched technologies
        (known as the \u201ctuning adapter\u201d), if this technology is not successful
        or is not adopted by our customers (due to cost, complexity, functionality,
        or other reasons), then the increased use of switched technologies and the
        continued inability of our products to receive switched cable programming
        without a tuning adapter may reduce the desirability and competitiveness of
        our products and services and adversely affect sales of our tivo-owned subscriptions
        in which case our business would be harmed. similarly, if cable operators
        implement new technologies in the future to transmit television programming
        that do not allow programs to be received and displayed on our retail products,
        the desirability and competitiveness of our products and services will be
        adversely affected and impact the sales of our tivo-owned products and services,
        in which case our business would be harmed.16table of contents\u00a0legislation,
        laws or regulations that govern the consumer electronics and television industry,
        the delivery of programming, access to television signals, and the collection
        of viewing information from subscriptions could expose us to legal action
        if we fail to comply and could adversely impact and/or could require us to
        change our business.the delivery of television programming, access to television
        signals by consumer electronics devices, and the collection of viewing information
        from subscriptions via the tivo service and a dvr represent a relatively new
        category in the television and home entertainment industries. as such, it
        is difficult to predict what laws or regulations will govern our business.
        changes in the regulatory climate, the enactment of new legislation, or the
        expansion, contraction, enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or
        regulations could expose us to additional costs and expenses and could adversely
        impact or require changes to our business. for example, legislation regarding
        customer privacy or copyright could be enacted or expanded to apply to the
        tivo service, which could adversely affect our business. laws or regulations
        could be interpreted to prevent or limit access to some or all television
        signals by certain consumer electronics devices, or impose limits on the number
        of copies, the ability to transfer or move copies, or the length of time a
        consumer may retain copies of some or all types of television programming.
        new or existing copyright laws could be applied to restrict the capture of
        television programming, which would adversely affect our business. it is unknown
        whether existing laws and regulations will apply to the digital video recorder
        market. therefore, it is difficult to anticipate the impact of current or
        future laws and regulations on our business. we may have significant expenses
        associated with staying appraised of local, state, federal, and international
        legislation and regulation of our business and in presenting tivo''s positions
        on proposed laws and regulations.the fcc has broad jurisdiction over the telecommunications
        and cable industries. the fcc could promulgate new regulations, or interpret
        existing regulations in a manner that would cause us to incur significant
        compliance costs or force us to alter or eliminate certain features or functionality
        of the tivo products or services which may adversely affect our business.
        for example, the fcc could determine that certain of our products fail to
        comply with regulations concerning matters such as electrical interference,
        copy protection, digital tuners, or display of television programming based
        on rating systems. the fcc could also impose limits on the number of copies,
        the ability to transfer or move copies, the length of time a consumer may
        retain copies, or the ability to access some or all types of television programming.  each
        of which could reduce the desirability of our products and services or increase
        our compliance costs.we face risks in connection with our marketing and distribution
        agreements for the development and deployment of tivo-branded advanced television
        solutions and services to our marketing partners and distributors, particularly
        as our ability to perform and meet such contractual arrangements may be dependent
        on our ability to gain access to certain necessary third-party technologies.we
        face significant technological challenges in our development of the tivo service
        for our marketing partners and distributors as well as challenges related
        to our dependence on certain third-party technology providers upon whom we
        depend to provide technology to us to allow us to meet the agreed upon feature
        and technology requirements requested by our television service providers.
        for example, we rely on access to and receipt of certain technologies from
        third-parties to enable video on demand and other content and search features
        on our products. additionally, we have engaged in intellectual property infringement
        suits with parties that we may otherwise rely on for the delivery of necessary
        technologies for the enablement of key features of our products and as required
        by our contractual arrangements with our television service provider customers.
        for example, we previously engaged in patent infringement litigation with
        motorola and microsoft, who also license technology to us for use in our products
        to enable certain features. if we were unable to gain access to such technologies
        on reasonable commercial terms, we may be unable to provide certain features
        and functionalities in our products. in such an event, our products may not
        be competitive with similar products in the market and further we may not
        be able to comply with the contractual arrangements with certain of our television
        service providers, and in either case our business would be harmed as a result.
        our ability to benefit from these agreements is dependent upon the mass deployment
        and adoption of our tivo-branded advanced television solutions, which may
        include tivo-branded dvrs, third-party set-top boxes which run tivo software,
        and dvr and non-dvr set-top boxes, among other solutions, by the subscribers
        of our distribution customers and marketing partners. if we are unable to
        complete development of these products in a timely and efficient manner to
        the satisfaction of our distribution customers, which includes hiring and
        retaining the necessary number of engineers and software developers to develop
        each partner''s customized solution, correctly estimating the amount of time
        and resources that are necessary to develop each such solution, licensing
        necessary third-party technology (such as, for example, technology which enables
        the display of vod content from our partners), and enabling full-scale deployment
        of our tivo-branded advanced television solutions and services with these
        marketing partners and distributors, we may not be able to acquire new subscribers
        from them under these agreements and our business would be harmed. 17table
        of contentsfurthermore, some of our partners have the right to receive certain
        most favored terms from us such that if we were to license similar products
        and services to other parties at more attractive terms than what such partners
        receive under their agreements with us, then such partners may be entitled
        to receive the new more favorable terms. additionally, such partners may have
        the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event we are subject
        to certain specified change of control transactions involving companies specified
        in their agreements. further, if any of our partners are subject to a change
        of control transaction, our business could be harmed if such acquiring company
        chose to favor a technology provider other than us, despite the fact that
        many of our agreements with our partners include exclusivity provisions, minimum
        deployment commitments, or minimum financial commitments. if any of these
        events occur, including our inability to develop, license, and deploy in a
        timely, efficient, and on a full-scale basis, we will have difficulty generating
        revenues and new subscriptions under these agreements and our business would
        be harmed.if we fail to adequately manage our increasingly complex distribution
        agreements, including licensing, development, and engineering services, we
        could be subjected to unexpected delays in the expected deployment of tivo''s
        advanced television solutions, increased costs, possible penalties and adverse
        accounting and contractual consequences, including termination of such distribution
        arrangements. in any such event, our business would be harmed.in connection
        with our deployment arrangements, we engage in complex licensing, development,
        and engineering services arrangements with our marketing partners and distributors.
        these deployment agreements with television service providers usually provide
        for some or all of the following deliverables: software engineering services,
        solution integration services, hosting of the tivo service, maintenance, and
        support. in general, these contracts are long-term and complex and often rely
        on the timely performance of such television service provider''s third-party
        vendors that are outside tivo''s control. the engineering services and technology
        we agree to provide and/or develop may be essential to the functionality of
        the licensed software and delivered product or such software may involve significant
        customization and modification for each customer. we have experienced or may
        experience delays in delivery with television service providers including,
        for example, directv, virgin, suddenlink, com hem, and ono, as well as significant
        increases in expected costs of development and performance in certain instances
        in the past. additional delays could lead to additional costs and adverse
        accounting treatments forcing us to recognize costs earlier than expected.
        if we are unable to deliver the contracted for technology, including specified
        customizations and modifications, and services in a timely manner or at all,
        then we could face penalties in the form of unreimbursed engineering development
        work, loss of subscriber or minimum financial commitments on the part of our
        partners or in extreme cases the early termination of such distribution agreements.
        in any such case our business would be harmed.if we fail to properly estimate,
        manage, and perform the development and engineering services for our television
        service provider customers, we could incur additional unexpected expenses
        and losses which could reduce or even eliminate any profit from these deployment
        arrangements, in which case our business would be harmed. when we enter into
        deployment agreements with television service providers, we are typically
        required to make cost estimates based on historical experience and various
        other assumptions. these estimates are assessed continually during the term
        of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known.
        using different cost estimates related to engineering services may produce
        materially different operating results, in addition to differences in timing
        and income statement classification of related expenses and revenues. an unfavorable
        change in estimates could result in a reduction of profit due to higher cost
        or the recording of a loss once such a loss becomes known to us that would
        be borne solely by us. we also recognize revenues for software engineering
        services that are essential to the functionality of the software or involve
        significant customization or modification using the percentage-of-completion
        method. we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward completion based
        on the ratio of costs incurred, principally labor, to total estimated costs
        of the project, an input method. if we are unable to properly measure and
        estimate our progress toward completion in such circumstances, we could incur
        unexpected additional costs, be required to recognize certain costs earlier
        than expected, or otherwise be required to delay recognition of revenues unexpectedly.
        a material inability to properly manage, estimate, and perform these development
        and engineering services for our television service provider customers could
        cause us to incur unexpected losses and reduce or even eliminate any profit
        from these arrangements, and in such a case our business would be harmed.if
        we our unable to renew or extend our existing contract with directv, our business
        could be harmed. directv is our largest mso subscription customer by revenue,
        but no longer represents a meaningful portion of our 3.2 million mso subscription
        base. the fees paid by directv are subject to monthly minimum payments that
        escalate during the term of the agreement (which expires on february 15, 2015,
        unless extended until 18table of contentsfebruary 15, 2018 by directv) and
        the revenues from directv are material to tivo''s net income. due to the decline
        in the number of directv mso subscriptions in recent years, in fiscal year
        2014, we recognized the monthly minimum amount each month during the entire
        year. we incur limited recurring expenses related to the directv relationship.
        if we are unable to renew or extend our existing contract with directv on
        similar terms, then our business could be harmed.many of our current deployment
        arrangements with television service providers require us to incur significant
        upfront development and engineering expenses for which we are in total or
        in part compensated through future service fees received after a solution
        is launched. if we are required to incur such upfront development and integration
        costs in excess of any development revenues and we are reasonably assured
        that these excess upfront development costs are recoverable, we will defer
        such cost and recognize them on a zero margin or straight-line basis after
        the solution is launched. however, despite the deferral of these development
        costs, we do incur cash outflows associated with these development efforts
        resulting in potentially higher cash usage in the near term. in situations
        where we are recovering upfront project-specific development costs, we would
        start recognizing service revenues (and related margin) only after the initial
        project-specific development costs are fully recovered. as of january 31,
        2014, we had approximately $27.2 million in such project-specific deferred
        costs. the assessment of recoverability is highly dependent on our estimates
        of engineering and operating costs related to the project. as a consequence,
        it may be a significant period of time after a solution launches and after
        we are adding new subscriptions from such deployment arrangement before we
        experience a corresponding impact on our service revenues (and related margins)
        from such a deployment arrangement. if we fail to properly estimate, manage,
        and perform these development and engineering services and otherwise comply
        with the terms of these deployment arrangements, we could incur additional
        unexpected expenses and losses in connection with these arrangements.in the
        event of an early termination of these arrangements with our television service
        provider customers prior to deployment, we would be forced to recognize any
        deferred development costs which we have incurred but not recognized without
        corresponding revenues from development or subscription fees, and in such
        an event we would be forced to incur unexpected losses. from time to time
        during development and integration for our television service provider customers,
        we or our customers may request to revise certain terms of our contracts or
        statements of work to modify such deliverables required or to otherwise address
        circumstances and technological requirements not anticipated by the parties
        when the contract or statement of work was originally agreed upon. additionally,
        from time to time, we have experienced delays and may in the future experience
        delays in our development work with our television service provider customers,  which
        may cause us to modify the terms of those arrangements. if we were to fail
        in modifying the terms of these arrangements to the satisfaction of both parties
        and the arrangements were unexpectedly terminated early, we would have to
        recognize immediately any associated deferred costs that may no longer be
        deemed recoverable. in such an event that we would have to recognize early
        such deferred development and integration costs, we would be required to do
        so without any corresponding revenue in which case we would incur unexpected
        losses which would harm our business.we face risks from the consolidation
        or change of control of television service providers both in the u.s. and
        internationally. we have marketing and distribution agreements with a number
        of different television service providers for the licensing and distribution
        of our technology, products, and services. to the extent our existing television
        service providers merge or are acquired by other television service providers,
        we risk losing an existing customer whose new owner may have an existing relationship
        with a competitor or we risk the loss of a potential customer who otherwise
        may have been interested in our products and services but whose new owner
        may not. we may also experience delays in adoption of our products or services
        due to a change in control of such television service providers.  recently
        vodefone has announced a proposal to acquire our customer ono and comcast
        has agreed to acquire our customer time warner cable.  in the event of such
        consolidation in the television industry, our business could be harmed by
        the loss of existing or potential future customers opportunities.we face intense
        competition from a number of sources, which may impair our revenues, increase
        our subscription acquisition costs, and hinder our ability to generate new
        subscriptions.the dvr and advanced television solutions market is rapidly
        evolving, and we face significant competition. moreover, the market for in-home
        entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological
        change. as a result of this intense competition, we could incur increased
        subscription acquisition costs that could adversely affect our ability to
        reach or sustain profitability in the future. if new technologies render the
        dvr market obsolete, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover
        our expenses and obligations.19table of contentswe believe that the principal
        competitive factors in the dvr and advanced television solutions market are
        brand recognition and awareness, functionality, ease of use, content availability,
        and pricing. we currently see two primary categories of dvr competitors and
        advanced television solutions competitors: dvrs and advanced television solutions
        (e.g. vod and ott capabilities) offered by telecommunications, cable and satellite
        operators and dvrs and other advanced television solutions (e.g. vod based
        services on set-top boxes or other consumer electronic devices (tv, bluray
        player, etc.) which stream content remotely) offered by consumer electronics
        and software companies.our revenues depend both upon our ability to successfully
        negotiate agreements with service provider customers and, in turn, upon our
        customers'' successful commercialization of our licensed products and technology.
        we face competition from companies such as ericsson (mediaroom), pace, motorola
        (whose set-top box division was acquired by arris), cisco/nds, and rovi.\u00a0such
        companies may offer more economically attractive agreements to service providers
        and manufacturers of dvrs.  we also face competition from solutions that msos
        may internally develop such as comcast x1 and directv genie, each of which
        have created competing technologies.we face a number of competitive challenges
        in the sale and marketing of the tivo service and products that enable the
        retail version of the tivo service.our success depends upon the successful
        retail marketing of the tivo service and related dvrs.we compete with other
        consumer electronics products and home entertainment services for consumer
        spending. dvrs and the tivo service compete in markets that are crowded with
        other consumer electronics products and home entertainment services. the competition
        for consumer spending is intense, and many consumers may choose other products
        and services over ours. dvrs compete for consumer spending with products such
        as dvd players, satellite television systems, personal computers, video game
        consoles, and other dedicated over-the-top video streaming devices (such as
        roku and appletv). the tivo service competes with home entertainment services
        such as cable and satellite television, movie rentals, pay-per-view, video
        on demand, and mail-order dvd services. such competition could harm our business,
        financial condition, and results of operations. \u00a0many of these products
        or services have established markets, broad user bases, and proven consumer
        acceptance. in addition, many of the manufacturers and distributors of these
        competing devices and services have substantially greater brand recognition,
        market presence, distribution channels, advertising and marketing budgets
        and promotional activities, and more strategic partners. faced with this competition,
        we may be unable to effectively differentiate our dvrs and the tivo service
        from other consumer electronics devices or entertainment services and our
        business, financial condition, and results of operations would be harmed.consumers
        may not be willing to pay for our products and services, we may be forced
        to discount our products and services, and we may introduce products and services
        at lower price points which could impact our revenues. many of our customers
        already pay monthly fees for cable or satellite television. we must convince
        these consumers to pay an additional subscription fee to receive the tivo
        service. consumers may perceive the tivo service and related dvr and non-dvr
        products as too expensive. in order to continue to grow our subscription base,
        we have lowered the price of our dvrs in the past and raised our subscription
        pricing and alternatively we may choose to raise our dvr pricing and lower
        our subscription pricing in the future. as a result of lower hardware pricing
        and higher subscription pricing, the profitability of such newly acquired
        customers was shifted outward in time as we need to first recoup the expenses
        incurred in connection with the sale of a heavily subsidized dvr. for competitive
        and financial reasons, we may need to change the pricing of our dvrs and our
        service fees again in the future. furthermore, we have introduced non-dvr
        products such as tivo mini meant to expand the tivo experience throughout
        the home, but such a product has a lower hardware cost and lower associated
        service fees and it may impact our total revenues as well as our arpu per
        subscription to the extent these products are offered at lower subscription
        price points. the availability of competing services that do not require subscription
        fees or that are enabled by low or no cost dvrs will harm our ability to effectively
        attract and retain subscriptions, and in such an event our business would
        be harmed.growth in our tivo-owned subscriptions and related revenues could
        be harmed by offerings by our television distribution partners who also would
        be able to offer the tivo service in the future. our ability to grow our tivo-owned
        subscriptions and related revenues could be harmed by competition from our
        television distribution partners, such as directv, rcn, suddenlink, and others,
        who may be able to offer tivo-branded dvr and non-dvr solutions to their customers
        at more attractive pricing than we may be able to offer the tivo service to
        our tivo-owned customers. furthermore, if we are unable to sufficiently differentiate
        the tivo service offered direct to consumers by tivo from the tivo-branded
        dvr solutions offered by our licensing partners, 20table of contentscustomers
        who would have otherwise chosen the tivo service offered direct to consumers
        by us may instead choose to purchase the tivo-branded dvr solution from our
        licensing partners. additionally, to the extent that potential customers defer
        subscribing to the tivo service in order to wait for announced, but not yet
        deployed in their geographic area, tivo-branded dvr solutions from our licensing
        partners, the growth of our tivo-owned subscriptions could be reduced. if
        our tivo-owned subscriptions continue to decrease, our business will be harmed.we
        compete with digital cable, satellite, and telecommunications dvrs. cable,
        satellite, and telecommunications service providers are accelerating deployment
        of integrated cable and satellite receivers with dvrs that bundle dvr services
        with other digital services and do not require their customers to purchase
        hardware. if we are not able to enter into agreements with these service providers
        to embed the tivo service into their offerings, our ability to attract their
        subscribers to the tivo service will be limited and our business, financial
        condition, and results of operations would be harmed.we also expect to compete
        with digital cable, satellite, and telecommunications services that provide
        consumers with dvr and vod-based services via a broadband connection on an
        on-demand basis. we are aware of at least one u.s. cable operator, cablevision,
        inc., which has deployed server-based dvr technology. to the extent that cable,
        satellite, or telecommunication operators offer regular television programming
        with dvr services as part of their server-based vod offerings or offer linear
        television programming in other vod-based broadband delivered services, consumers
        would have an alternate means of watching time-shifted shows besides physical
        dvrs. in such an event, competitors would be able to deploy competing dvr
        services or equivalent vod-based viewing services (such as the increasing
        tv everywhere services from most pay tv) without the expense of deploying
        dvr hardware in consumer homes. such an event would impair our ability to
        compete in a cost-effective manner with these television providers as well
        as attract and retain customers, in which case, our business, financial condition,
        and results of operations would be harmed.it is expensive to establish a strong
        brand. we believe that establishing and strengthening the tivo brand is critical
        to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and to establishing
        key strategic relationships. the importance of brand recognition will increase
        as current and potential competitors enter the dvr market with competing products
        and services. our ability to promote and position our brand depends largely
        on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality
        services and customer support. these activities are expensive and we may not
        generate a corresponding increase in subscriptions or revenues to justify
        these costs. if we fail to establish and maintain our brand, or if our brand
        value is damaged or diluted, we may be unable to attract subscriptions and
        effectively compete in the dvr market.we rely on our retail partners and service
        providers to market and distribute our products and services. in addition
        to our own efforts, our retail partners distribute dvrs that enable the tivo
        service. we rely on their sales forces, marketing budgets, and brand images
        to promote and support dvrs and the tivo service. additionally, we now have
        arrangements with many service providers, both domestically and internationally,
        to market and promote the tivo service. we expect to continue to rely on our
        relationships with these companies to promote and support dvrs and other devices
        that enable the tivo service. the loss of one or more of these companies could
        require us to undertake more of these activities on our own. further, if any
        of our service providers elect to support a competing technology, our business
        could be harmed despite the fact that many of our agreements with our service
        providers include exclusivity provisions, minimum deployment commitments,
        or minimum financial commitments. as a result, we would spend significant
        resources to support the tivo service and dvrs and other devices that enable
        the tivo service or would otherwise see a reduction in new and existing service
        provider deployments from such service providers. the failure of one or more
        of these companies to provide anticipated marketing support will require us
        to divert more of our limited resources to marketing the tivo service. if
        we are unable to provide adequate marketing support for dvrs and the tivo
        service, our ability to attract additional subscriptions to the tivo service
        will be limited.many consumers are not aware of the full range of benefits
        of our products and services. dvr products and services are a continually
        evolving consumer electronic category. retailers, consumers, and potential
        partners may perceive little or no benefit from dvr products and services.
        many consumers are not aware of its benefits, such as the ability to seamlessly
        integrate linear and broadband/vod-based video, time-shifting of linear television,
        transfer of recorded programs to portable devices, access to web based and
        broadband delivered content not available through traditional cable and satellite
        operators, and therefore may not value the benefits of the tivo service and
        products. we will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time
        and resources to educate consumers and promote our products in order to increase
        our subscriptions. we cannot be sure that a broad base of consumers will ultimately
        subscribe to the tivo service or purchase the products that enable the tivo
        service.21table of contentswe face competitive risks in the provision of an
        entertainment offering involving the distribution of digital content through
        broadband, including from broadband devices connected directly to the tv or
        through a pc or other device connected to the tv.we have previously launched
        access to the entertainment offerings of amazon video on demand service, netflix,
        hulu plus, pandora, and others for the distribution of digital content directly
        to broadband-connected tivo devices. our offerings with amazon video on demand,
        netflix, hulu plus, pandora, and others typically involve no significant long-term
        commitments. we face competitive, technological, and business risks in our
        ongoing provision of an entertainment offering involving the distribution
        of digital content through broadband to consumer televisions with amazon,
        netflix, and others, including the availability of premium and high-definition
        content, as well as the speed and quality of the delivery of such content
        to tivo devices. for instance, we face increased competition from a growing
        number of broadband-enabled devices from providers such as roku, appletv,
        and google that provide broadband delivered digital content directly to a
        consumer''s television connected to such a device. additionally, we face competition
        from online content providers and other pc software providers who deliver
        digital content directly to a consumer''s personal computer, which in some
        cases may then be viewed on a consumer''s television. if we are unable to
        provide a competitive entertainment offering with amazon video on demand,
        netflix, hulu plus, pandora, and our other partners, on our own, or an equivalent
        offering with other third-parties, the attractiveness of the tivo service
        to new subscribers would be harmed as consumers increasingly look for new
        ways to receive and view digital content and our ability to retain and attract
        subscribers would be harmed.our ability to retain our current customers may
        continue to decrease in the future which could increase our tivo-owned subscription
        monthly churn rate and could cause our revenues to suffer.we believe factors
        such as increased competition in the dvr marketplace, failure by us to continue
        to innovate and deliver new features on current deployed dvrs as well as deliver
        new dvr models in the future, changing television technologies such as the
        increasing penetration of high definition, the use of switched digital technology
        to deliver encrypted digital television signals, and the failure of cable
        operators in the future to transmit both an analog and digital transmission
        thus impacting our series2 dvrs, increased price sensitivity in the consumer
        base, any deterioration in the quality of our service, and product lifetime
        subscriptions no longer using our service may cause our tivo-owned subscription
        monthly churn rate to increase. if we are unable to retain our subscriptions
        by limiting the factors that increase subscription churn, our ability to grow
        our subscription base could suffer and our revenues would be harmed.the product
        lifetime subscriptions to the tivo service that we currently are obligated
        to service commit us to providing services for an indefinite period. the revenue
        we generate from these subscriptions may be insufficient to cover future costs
        and will negatively impact our tivo-owned average revenue per subscription.we
        offer a product lifetime subscription option to the tivo service that commits
        us to provide the tivo service for as long as the dvr is in service. we receive
        product lifetime subscription fees for the tivo service in advance and amortize
        these fees as subscription revenue over 66 months for product lifetime subscriptions
        which is our current estimate of the service life of the dvr. if these product
        lifetime subscriptions use the dvr for longer than anticipated, we will incur
        costs such as telecommunications and customer support costs without a corresponding
        subscription revenue stream and therefore will be required to fund ongoing
        costs of service from other sources, such as advertising revenue. additionally,
        if these product lifetime subscriptions use the dvr for longer than the period
        in which we recognize revenue, our average revenue per subscription (arpu)
        for our tivo-owned subscriptions will be negatively impacted as we continue
        to count these customers as subscriptions without corresponding subscription
        revenue thus lowering our average revenues across our tivo-owned subscription
        base. as of january 31, 2014, we had approximately 171,000 product lifetime
        subscriptions that had exceeded the 66 month period we use to recognize product
        lifetime subscription revenues and had made contact with the tivo service
        within the prior six-month period. we will continue to monitor the useful
        life of a tivo-enabled dvr and the impact of higher churn, increased competition,
        and compatibility of our existing tivo units with high-definition programming.
        future results will allow us to determine if our useful life is shorter or
        longer than currently estimated, in which case we may revise the estimated
        life and we would recognize revenues from this source over a shorter or longer
        period.we face intense competition for advertising and research revenues.dvr
        services, in general, and tivo, specifically, compete with other advertising
        media such as print, radio, television, internet, vod, and other emerging
        advertising platforms for a share of advertisers'' total advertising budgets.
        if advertisers do not perceive digital video recording services, in general,
        and tivo specifically, as an effective advertising medium, they may be reluctant
        to advertise on the tivo service. in addition, advertisers may 22table of
        contentsnot support or embrace the tivo technology due to a belief that our
        technology''s ability to fast-forward through commercials will reduce the
        effectiveness of general television advertising. due to the slower than anticipated
        adoption of tra''s services for the anonymous matching of ad exposure data
        with purchase data, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $4.8 million
        in the three and twelve months ended january 31 2014 related to intangible
        assets acquired as part of the tra acquisition.the nature of some of our business
        relationships may restrict our ability to operate freely in the future.from
        time to time, we have engaged and may engage in the future in discussions
        with other parties concerning business relationships, which have and may in
        the future include equity investments by such parties in us or may include
        exclusivity provisions (such as geographic or product specific limitations),
        most favored customer limitations, and patent licensing arrangements. while
        we believe that such business relationships have historically enhanced our
        ability to finance and develop our business model or otherwise were justified
        by the terms of the particular relationship, the terms and conditions of such
        business relationships may place some restrictions on the operation of our
        business, including where we operate, who we work with, and what kinds of
        activities we may engage in, in the future.we depend on a limited number of
        third-parties to manufacture, distribute, and supply critical components,
        assemblies, and services for the dvrs that enable the tivo service. we may
        be unable to operate our business if these parties do not perform their obligations.the
        tivo service is enabled through the use of a dvr manufactured for us by a
        third-party contract manufacturer. in addition, we rely on sole suppliers
        for a number of key components for these dvrs and other devices we manufacture.
        we also rely on third-parties with whom we outsource supply-chain activities
        related to inventory warehousing, order fulfillment, distribution, and other
        direct sales logistics. we cannot be sure that these parties will perform
        their obligations as expected or that any revenue, cost savings, or other
        benefits will be derived from the efforts of these parties. if any of these
        parties breaches or terminates its agreement with us or otherwise fails to
        perform its obligations in a timely manner, we may be delayed or prevented
        from commercializing our products and services. because our relationships
        with these parties are non-exclusive, they may also support products and services
        that compete directly with us, or offer similar or greater support to our
        competitors. any of these events could require us to undertake unforeseen
        additional responsibilities or devote additional resources to commercialize
        our products and services. this outcome would harm our ability to compete
        effectively and achieve increased market acceptance and brand recognition.in
        addition, we face the following risks in relying on these third-parties:if
        our manufacturing relationships are not successful, we may be unable to satisfy
        demand for our products and services. we manufacture dvrs that enable the
        tivo service through a third-party contract manufacturer. delays, product
        shortages, and other problems could impair our retail distribution and brand
        image and make it difficult for us to attract subscriptions. in addition,
        the loss of a manufacturer would require us to identify and contract with
        alternative sources of manufacturing, which we may be unable to do or which
        could prove time-consuming and expensive.we are dependent on sole suppliers
        for key components and services. if these suppliers fail to perform their
        obligations, we may be unable to find alternative suppliers or deliver our
        products and services to our customers on time. we currently rely on sole
        suppliers for a number of the key components used in the tivo-enabled dvrs
        and the tivo service, of which we may not have written supply agreements with
        certain sole suppliers for key components or services for our products. for
        example, broadcom is the sole supplier of the system controller for our dvr.
        we do not currently have a long-term written supply agreement with broadcom
        although we do have limited rights to continue to purchase from broadcom in
        the event broadcom notifies us a product is being discontinued. therefore,
        broadcom is not contractually obligated to supply us with these key components
        on a long-term basis or at all. in addition, because we are dependent on sole
        suppliers for key components and services, our ability to manufacture our
        dvrs and other devices is subject to increased risks of supply shortages (without
        immediately available alternatives), exposure to unexpected cost increases
        in such sole supplied components, as well as other risks to our business if
        we were to fail to comply with conflict mineral requirements due to our reliance
        on these suppliers.tribune is the sole supplier of the program guide data
        for the tivo service. tribune media services, inc., (tribune), is the current
        sole supplier of program guide data for the tivo service. our current television
        listings data agreement with tribune originally became effective on may\u00a014,
        2007 and had an initial term of five years which tivo has renewed for four
        additional years. the agreement provides each party with a termination right
        if the other party becomes controlled by certain third parties. if tribune
        breaches its obligation to provide us with data, rejects the agreement or
        otherwise fails to perform its obligations under our agreement, we would be
        unable to 23table of contentsprovide certain aspects of the tivo service to
        our customers until we are able to incorporate an alternate source of guide
        data. while we have a license to an alternative sources of guide data, we
        are not currently using it and there would be significant cost and delay involved
        in integrating such an alternative source of guide data should we do so in
        the future. depending upon the amount of notice we receive of such a breach
        or rejection of our agreement, and the amount of development work required
        by us to incorporate an alternate source of guide data, we may be subject
        to a period of time in which we are unable to provide the tivo service to
        our customers and distribution partners. in such an event, our business would
        be harmed.\u00a0if our arrangements with broadcom or tribune or with our third-party
        contract manufacturer were to terminate or expire without a replacement arrangement
        in place, or if we or our manufacturers were unable to obtain sufficient quantities
        of these components or required program guide data from our suppliers, our
        search for alternate suppliers could result in significant delays, added expense
        or disruption in product or service availability.we depend upon third-parties
        to provide supply chain services related to inventory management, order fulfillment,
        and direct sales logistics. we rely on third-party vendors to provide cost-effective
        and efficient supply chain services. among other activities, these outsourced
        services relate to direct sales logistics, including order fulfillment, inventory
        management and warehousing, and distribution of inventory to third-party retailers.
        if one or several of our third-party supply chain partners were to discontinue
        services for us, our ability to fulfill direct sales orders and distribute
        inventory timely, cost effectively, or at all, would be hindered which could
        in turn harm our business.we are dependent on our major retail partners for
        distribution of our products to consumers. we currently rely on our relationships
        with major retail distributors including best buy, amazon, and others for
        distribution of tivo-enabled dvrs. we do not typically enter into long-term
        volume commitments with our major retail distributors. if one or several of
        our major retail partners were to discontinue selling our products, the volume
        of tivo-enabled dvrs sold to consumers could decrease which could in turn
        harm our business.we face significant risks in overseeing our outsourcing
        of manufacturing processes as well as in the management of our inventory,
        and failure to properly oversee our manufacturing processes or to effectively
        manage our inventory levels may result in product recalls or supply imbalances
        that could harm our business.we have contracted for the manufacture of certain
        tivo-enabled dvrs with a contract manufacturer. we sell these units to retailers
        and distributors, as well as through our own online sales channels. product
        manufacturing is outside our core business and we face significant risks if
        our contract manufacturer does not perform as expected. if we fail to effectively
        oversee the manufacturing process, including the work performed by our contract
        manufacturer, we could suffer from product recalls, poorly performing product,
        and higher than anticipated warranty costs.\u00a0in connection with our manufacturing
        operations, we maintain a finished goods inventory of the dvr units we produce
        throughout the year. due to the seasonality in our business and our long-lead
        time product development and manufacturing cycles, we need to make forecasts
        of demand and commit significant resources towards manufacturing of our dvr
        units well in advance of our peak selling periods. we also have risks with
        respect to changing hardware forecasts with our television service provider
        customers who may revise their purchase forecasts lower after we have committed
        manufacturing resources to meeting such forecasts due to long-lead times and
        prior to the time in which such television service provider forecasts become
        contractually binding. as such, we are subject to significant risks in managing
        the inventory needs of our business during the year, including estimates of
        the appropriate mix of demand across our older and newer dvr models. if we
        were to overestimate demand for our dvrs, we may end up with inventories that
        exceed currently forecasted demand which would require us to record additional
        write-downs. should actual market conditions differ from our estimates, our
        future results of operations could be materially affected. in the future,
        we may be required to record additional write-downs of finished products and
        materials on-hand and/or additional charges for excess purchase commitments
        as a result of future changes in our sales forecasts.new regulations related
        to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses,
        may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation
        with customers.on august 22, 2012, under the dodd-frank wall street reform
        and consumer protection act of 2010, or the dodd-frank act, the sec adopted
        new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known
        as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are
        manufactured by third-parties. these requirements will require companies to
        perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate
        from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries. the implementation
        of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability,
        and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of 24table of contentsour
        products and the numerous components that go into our products. for instance,
        a number of our key components in our products are supplied from a single
        source, and finding alternatives components that would be conflict mineral
        free in some cases could be expensive and cause delays in our ability to manufacture
        our products and meet customer demand. in addition, we will incur additional
        costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related
        to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used
        in our products. since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to
        sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our
        products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may
        harm our reputation. in such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying
        customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified
        as conflict mineral free.we face significant risks to our business when we
        engage in the outsourcing of engineering work, including outsourcing of software
        work oversees, which, if not properly managed, could result in the loss of
        valuable intellectual property, increased costs due to inefficient and poor
        work product, and subject us to export control restrictions which could impede
        or prevent us from working with partners internationally, which could harm
        our business, including our financial results, reputation, and brand.we have
        from time-to-time outsourced engineering work related to the design, development,
        and manufacturing of our products, typically to save money and gain access
        to additional engineering resources. we have worked, and expect to in the
        future work, with companies located in jurisdictions outside of the united
        states, including, but not limited to, india, ukraine, the united kingdom,
        and mexico. we have limited experience in the outsourcing of engineering,
        manufacturing, and other work to third-parties located internationally that
        operate under different laws and regulations than those in the united states.
        if we are unable to properly manage and oversee the outsourcing of this engineering,
        manufacturing and other work related to our products, we could suffer the
        loss of valuable intellectual property, or the loss of the ability to claim
        such intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets,
        and copyrights. we could also be subjected to increased regulatory and other
        scrutiny related to export control restrictions which could impede or prevent
        us from working with international partners. additionally, instead of saving
        money, we could in fact incur significant additional costs as a result of
        inefficient engineering services and poor work product. as a result our business
        would be harmed, including our financial results, reputation, and brand.product
        defects, system failures, or interruptions to the tivo service may have a
        negative impact on our revenues, damage our reputation and decrease our ability
        to attract new customers as well as remain in contractual compliance with
        our existing mso customers.\u00a0our ability to provide uninterrupted service
        and high quality customer support depends on the efficient and uninterrupted
        operation of our computer and communications systems. our computer hardware
        and other operating systems for the tivo service are vulnerable to damage
        or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication
        failures, and similar events. they are also subject to break-ins, sabotage,
        intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct. our ability to provide
        uninterrupted service may also be impacted by internal system errors, bugs,
        and software deployment issues which may cause us to not meet mso customers.
        these types of interruptions in the tivo service may reduce our revenues and
        profits, including possible termination of existing mso customer contracts.
        we currently house the server hardware that delivers the tivo service at only
        one location; however, in the event that location became unavailable, we do
        have a backup facility capable of delivering the tivo service. our business
        also will be harmed if consumers or our mso customers believe our service
        is unreliable. in addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering
        staff, service outages create a high volume of customer questions and complaints
        that must be responded to by our customer support personnel. any frequent
        or persistent system failures could irreparably damage our reputation and
        brand and possibly trigger requests for refunds on subscription fees and hardware
        purchases and possible consumer litigation.we have detected in the past and
        may continue to detect software and manufacturing errors in our products in
        the future. these problems can affect system uptime and result in significant
        warranty and repair problems, which could cause customer service and customer
        relations problems. correcting errors in our software or fixing defects in
        our products requires significant time and resources, which could delay product
        releases and affect market acceptance of the tivo service. any delivery by
        us of products or upgrades with undetected material product defects or software
        errors could harm our credibility and market acceptance of the dvrs and the
        tivo service. in addition, defective products could cause a risk of injury
        that may subject us to litigation or cause us to have to undertake a product
        recall. for example, we previously became aware of occasions where a part
        came loose from the remote control device that comes with the dvrs that enable
        the tivo service, including occurrences where a young child gagged on or ingested
        a part of the remote control device. while we are unaware of any injuries
        resulting from the use of our products, we may be subject to products liability
        litigation in 25table of contentsthe future. additionally, if we are required
        to repair or replace any of our products, we could incur significant costs,
        which would harm our business, including our financial condition and results
        of operations.if we are unable to create or maintain multiple revenue streams,
        we may not be able to cover our expenses and this could cause our revenues
        to decrease and net losses to increase.our long-term success will depend on
        securing additional revenue from such areas as:\u00a0\u2022licensing;\u2022advertising;\u2022hardware
        sales\u2022audience research measurement; and\u2022electronic commerce.in
        order to derive substantial revenues from these activities, we will need to
        attract and retain a large and growing base of subscriptions to the tivo service.
        we also will need to work closely with television advertisers, cable, satellite,
        and telecommunications network operators, electronic commerce companies, and
        consumer electronics manufacturers to develop products and services in these
        areas. we may not be able to work effectively with these parties to develop
        products that generate revenues that are sufficient to justify their costs.
        we also may be unable to work with, or to continue working with, these parties
        to distribute video and collect and distribute data or other information to
        provide these product or services. in addition, we are currently obligated
        to share a portion of these revenues with several of our strategic partners.
        any inability to attract and retain a large and growing group of subscriptions
        or inability to attract new strategic partners or maintain and extend our
        relationships with our current strategic partners would seriously harm our
        ability to support new services and develop new revenue streams.\u00a0if we
        are unable to introduce new products or services, or if our new products and
        services are unsuccessful, the growth in our subscription base and revenues
        may suffer.to attract and retain subscriptions and generate revenues, we must
        continue to maintain and add to our functionality and content and introduce
        products and services which embody new technologies and, in some instances,
        new industry standards. this challenge will require hardware and software
        improvements, as well as maintaining and adding new collaborations with programmers,
        advertisers, network operators, hardware manufacturers, and other strategic
        partners. these activities require significant time and resources and may
        require us to develop and promote new ways of generating revenue with established
        companies in the television industry. these companies include television advertisers,
        cable and satellite network operators, electronic commerce companies, and
        consumer electronics manufacturers. in each of these examples, a small number
        of large companies dominate a major portion of the market and may be reluctant
        to work with us to develop new products and services for digital video recorders
        as well as maintain our current functionality. if we are unable to maintain
        and further develop and improve the tivo service or maintain and expand our
        operations in a cost-effective or timely manner, our ability to attract and
        retain customers and generate revenue will suffer.we must manage product transitions
        successfully in order to remain competitive.the introduction of a new product
        or product line is a complex task, involving significant expenditures in research
        and development, training, promotion and sales channel development, and management
        of existing product inventories to reduce the cost associated with returns
        and slow moving inventory. as new products are introduced, we intend to monitor
        closely the inventory of products to be replaced, and to phase out their manufacture
        in a controlled manner. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able
        to execute product transitions in this manner or that product transitions
        will be executed without harming our operating results. failure to develop
        products with required features and performance levels or any delay in bringing
        a new product to market could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our
        competitive position.we may not receive significant revenue from our current
        research and development efforts for several years, if at all.developing tivo
        products and integrating acquired technology into existing platforms is expensive,
        and these investments often require substantial time to generate returns.
        our strategy involves significant investments in research and development
        and related product opportunities. we believe that we must continue to dedicate
        a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts
        to maintain and improve our competitive position. however, we cannot ensure
        that we will receive significant, if any, revenue from these investments.26table
        of contentsif we fail to manage the growth and complexity of our activities,
        it could disrupt our business and impair our ability to generate revenues.the
        growth in our subscription base and increasing complexity of our sources of
        other revenue have placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain
        on our management, operational and financial resources, and systems. specific
        risks we face as our business expands include:any inability of our systems
        to accommodate future subscription growth, or any inability of our tivo.com
        website to handle customer traffic, may cause service interruptions or delay
        our introduction of new services and limit our ability to sell the tivo service
        and tivo-enabled dvrs. we internally developed many of the systems we use
        to provide the tivo service and perform other processing functions. the ability
        of these systems to scale as we add new subscriptions is unproven. we must
        continually improve these systems to accommodate subscription growth and to
        add features and functionality to the tivo service. our inability to add software
        and hardware or to upgrade our technology, systems or network infrastructure
        could adversely affect our business, cause service interruptions or delay
        the introduction of new services. our inability to manage customer traffic
        and sales volume through our tivo.com website could limit our ability to sell
        the tivo service and tivo-enabled dvrs in the future. if our website were
        to become unavailable for a significant amount of time, our ability to provide
        certain features of the tivo service and our ability to service customers
        and sell the tivo service and tivo-enabled dvrs would be harmed.\u00a0we need
        to provide acceptable customer support, particularly with respect to installation
        of dvrs and cablecardstm, and any inability to do so would harm our brand
        and ability to retain current subscriptions and generate new subscriptions.
        our ability to increase sales, retain current and future subscriptions and
        strengthen our brand will depend in part upon the quality of our customer
        support operations, including our ability to assist customers with installation
        and cablecardtm-related issues. some customers require significant support
        when installing the dvr and required cablecardstm for our hd dvrs and becoming
        acquainted with the features and functionality of the tivo service. we have
        limited experience with widespread deployment of our products, services, and
        cablecardtm installation requirements to a diverse customer base, and we may
        not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers
        require. in addition, we have entered into agreements with third-parties to
        provide this support and will rely on them for a substantial portion of our
        customer support functions. furthermore, the installation of a cablecardtm
        for tivo customers may be performed by third-party cable operators and tivo
        would then be dependent on such parties to timely service new subscribers
        to enable their receipt of digital and premium cable content. our failure
        to provide adequate customer support for the tivo service, dvrs, and a cablecardtm
        will damage our reputation in the dvr and consumer electronics marketplace
        and strain our relationships with customers and consumer electronics manufacturers.
        this could prevent us from gaining new or retaining existing subscriptions
        and could cause harm to our reputation and brand.we need to improve our operational
        and financial systems to support our growth in the future, increasingly complex
        business arrangements, and rules governing revenue and expense recognition
        and any inability to do so will adversely affect our billing and reporting.
        we have increasingly complex business arrangements, and the rules which govern
        revenue and expense recognition in our business are increasingly complex as
        well. to manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity,
        we will need to improve our operational and financial systems, procedures
        and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance
        on manual operations. any inability to do so will affect our billing and reporting.
        our current and planned systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate
        to support our complex arrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense
        recognition for our future operations and expected growth. delays or problems
        associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial
        systems and controls could adversely affect our relationships with our customers;
        cause harm to our reputation and brand; and could also result in errors in
        our financial and other reporting.the nature of our business requires the
        application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the current
        legislative and regulatory environment affecting u.s. generally accepted accounting
        principles (\"gaap\") is uncertain and volatile, and significant changes in
        current principles could affect our financial statements going forward.the
        accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and
        continually changing. recent actions and public comments from the securities
        exchange commission have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally.
        in addition, many companies'' accounting policies are being subject to heightened
        scrutiny by regulators and the public. while we believe that our financial
        statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
        accepted in the united states of america, we cannot predict the impact of
        future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies on our
        financial statements going forward. in addition, 27table of contentswere we
        to change our critical accounting estimates, including the timing of recognition
        of revenue from our product lifetime subscriptions, our results of operations
        could be significantly impacted.we have limited experience and face significant
        competition in providing service and operations internationally that are subject
        to different competitors, laws, regulations, and requirements than those in
        the united states and our inability to compete or comply with such laws, regulations,
        and requirements could harm our business, including our reputation and brand.we
        have provided and expect to continue to provide the tivo service in jurisdictions
        outside of the united states, such as the united kingdom, spain, sweden, mexico,
        canada, taiwan, australia, and new zealand. however, we have limited experience
        in international operations. there are risks inherent in doing business internationally,
        including privacy regulations that vary from country to country, global financial
        market turmoil, economic volatility and the global economic slowdown, currency
        exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures, the requirements of
        local laws and customs relating to the distribution of content and the display
        and sale of advertising, import or export restrictions and changes in trade
        regulations, difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations,
        issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor
        laws and regulations, and potentially adverse tax developments. in addition,
        we face significant competition and technological challenges in competing
        with other consumer electronics manufacturers in these jurisdictions and in
        complying with international laws and technological standards such the various
        digital over-the-air standards like dvb-t. if we are unable to properly manage
        our international operations or comply with international laws, regulations,
        and requirements, we could suffer damage to our reputation, brand, and revenues
        and as a result our business would be harmed. we have partnered, and expect
        to continue to partner, with local broadcasters, cable television operators,
        and satellite providers to provide the tivo service internationally. transactions
        with international partners may never materialize or may not result in significant
        revenue for us and may result in significant costs.entertainment companies
        and other content owners may claim that some of the features of our dvrs violate
        copyright or trademark laws, which could force us to incur significant costs
        in defending such actions and affect our ability to market the tivo service
        and the products that enable the tivo service.although we have not been the
        subject of such actions to date, a past competitor''s dvrs were the subject
        of several copyright infringement lawsuits by a number of major entertainment
        companies, including the major television networks. these lawsuits alleged
        that the competitor''s dvrs violate copyright laws by allowing users to skip
        commercials, delete recordings only when instructed and use the internet to
        send recorded materials to other users. tivo-enabled dvrs have some similar
        features, including the ability to fast-forward through commercials, the ability
        to delete recordings only when instructed and the ability to transfer recordings
        from a tivo-enabled dvr to a personal computer and/or portable media devices
        via tivotogo transfers. based on market or consumer pressures, we may decide
        in the future to add additional features that may be objectionable to entertainment
        companies. if similar actions are filed against us based on current or future
        features of our dvrs, entertainment companies may seek injunctions to prevent
        us from including these features and/or damages. such litigation can be costly
        and may divert the efforts of our management. furthermore, if we were ordered
        to remove features from our dvrs, we may experience increased difficulty in
        marketing the tivo service and related tivo-enabled dvrs and may suffer reduced
        revenues as a result.entertainment companies, networks, or video distributors
        may claim that our advertising products or features may unintentionally violate
        copyright or trademark laws or otherwise unfairly compete with them, which
        could result in the blocking, stripping or failure to carry out our advertising
        products or features or force us to incur significant costs in defending such
        actions and affect our ability to generate advertising revenues.entertainment
        companies, networks, or video distributors may claim that our advertising
        products or features may unintentionally violate copyright or trademark laws,
        or otherwise unfairly compete with them, by being placed within, adjacent
        to, or on top of, existing video programming or advertising. entertainment
        companies or video distributors may seek injunctions to prevent us from offering
        these products or features, seek damages and/or take other measures, such
        as blocking, stripping or refusing carriage to prevent us from selling or
        distributing our advertising products. if we were unable to sell or distribute
        our advertising products or features on our dvrs, we may suffer reduced revenues
        as a result.we use open source software in our products, which could expose
        us to intellectual property infringement claims, require us to provide indemnification
        to third-parties, and delay or prevent development of certain products or
        features, any of which could harm our business.28table of contentstivo''s
        products include open source software.\u00a0from time to time, we may face
        claims seeking to enforce the terms of an applicable open source license.\u00a0such
        claims could result in litigation, require us to seek licenses from third-parties
        in order to keep offering our software, require us to re-engineer our software,
        require us to release proprietary source code, require us to provide indemnification
        or otherwise subject us to liability to a customer or supplier, or require
        us to discontinue the sale of a product in the event re-engineering cannot
        be accomplished in a timely manner, any of which could adversely affect our
        business.if we release software that includes open source software licensed
        under\u00a0version 3 of the gnu general public license (\"gplv3\"), even if
        it was software provided to us by a supplier, we may be required to provide
        end users with the ability to install modified software on their tivo product,
        which could adversely affect our business.if gplv3 is widely adopted among
        the open source community, we may be unable to use future open source enhancements
        or components in our software, which could adversely affect our business.dvrs
        could be the subject of future regulation relating to copyright law or evolving
        industry standards and practices that could adversely impact our business.\u00a0in
        the future, copyright statutes or case law could be changed to adversely impact
        our business by restricting the ability of consumers to temporally or spatially
        shift copyrighted materials for their own personal use. our business would
        be harmed as a result. in addition, we are aware that some media companies
        may attempt to form organizations to develop standards and practices in the
        dvr industry. these organizations or individual media companies may attempt
        to require companies in the digital video recorder industry to obtain copyright
        or other licenses. lawsuits or other actions taken by these types of organizations
        or companies could make it more difficult for us to introduce new services,
        delay widespread consumer acceptance of our products and services, restrict
        our use of some television content, increase our costs, and adversely affect
        our business.we have acquired and may acquire other companies and businesses
        and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions.we have acquired
        and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future. on february
        24, 2014, we acquired digitalsmiths for $135 million in cash. our future revenue
        growth and expansion of our business may rely on our successful integration
        of this and other acquisitions. we may incur significant costs in connection
        with our potential transactions, including acquisitions that are not consummated.
        potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks. if any of
        the following acquisition-related risks occur, our business, operating results
        or financial condition could be seriously harmed:\u2022the failure to realize
        anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\u2022the
        failure to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively;\u2022the
        failure to retain key employees of the acquired company or business;\u2022difficulties
        in combining previously separate companies or businesses into a single unit;\u2022the
        substantial diversion of management''s attention from day-to-day business
        when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and integrating an acquired
        company or business;\u2022the discovery, after completion of the acquisition,
        of unanticipated liabilities assumed from the acquired company, business or
        assets, such that we cannot realize the anticipated value of the acquisition;\u2022difficulties
        related to integrating the products of an acquired company or business in,
        for example, distribution, engineering, licensing models, or customer support
        areas;\u2022unanticipated costs; or\u2022the failure to understand and compete
        effectively in markets where we have limited experience.future acquisitions
        may involve the issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase
        price for the acquired company or business, grants of restricted stock, restricted
        stock units, or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses
        (which may be dilutive to existing stockholders), expenditure of substantial
        cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt. these arrangements
        may impact our liquidity, financial position, and results of operations.compliance
        with federal securities laws and regulations is costly.the federal securities
        laws and regulations, including the corporate governance and other requirements
        of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and subsequent laws impose complex and continually
        changing regulatory 29table of contentsrequirements on our operations and
        reporting. these requirements impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure
        requirements, set stricter independence and financial expertise standards
        for audit committee members, and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies,
        their chief executive officers, chief financial officers, and directors for
        securities law violations. these requirements have increased and will continue
        to increase our legal compliance costs, increase the difficulty and expense
        in obtaining director and officer liability insurance, and make it harder
        for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and/or
        qualified executive officers. such developments could harm our results of
        operations and divert management''s attention from business operations.the
        investment of our cash, cash equivalents and investments in money market funds
        and marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses
        and affect the liquidity of these investments.our investments include various
        money market funds and marketable debt securities, such as corporate debt
        securities, u.s. treasury securities, bank certificates of deposit and commercial
        paper. weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general
        credit, liquidity, market prices and interest rates for these and other types
        of debt securities. additionally, changes in monetary policy by the federal
        open market committee and concerns about the rising u.s. government debt level
        may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the u.s. dollar and adversely
        affect our investment portfolio. furthermore, if there is a default or downgrade
        of u.s. government or agency debt securities, our investment portfolio may
        be adversely impacted, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect
        our liquidity, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. the
        financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio
        may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity,
        results of operations, or cash flows.our business could be adversely impacted
        if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal
        control over financial reporting.the design and effectiveness of our disclosure
        controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may
        not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. while management
        continues to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
        and internal control over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that our
        disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting
        will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time.
        for instance, recognizing the significant increase in our investments of cash
        as a result of our recent patent litigation settlements, we have instituted
        controls to monitor compliance with the investment company act of 1940 (the
        1940 act). if we fail to maintain compliance with the 1940 act in the future
        such as by failing to continue to qualify for the research and development
        exemption under the 1940 act, such noncompliance could have a significant
        adverse impact on our business. deficiencies, particularly a material weakness
        in internal control over financial reporting, which may occur in the future
        could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of
        our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, the delisting of our
        common stock from the nasdaq global market, or otherwise materially adversely
        affect our business, reputation, results of operation, financial condition
        or liquidity.we advertise, market, and sell our services directly to consumers;
        many of these activities are highly regulated by constantly evolving state
        and federal laws and regulations and violations of these laws and regulations
        could harm our business.we engage in various advertising, marketing, and other
        promotional activities, such as offering gift subscriptions to consumers,
        which are subject to state and federal laws and regulations. a constantly
        evolving network of state and federal laws is increasingly regulating these
        promotional activities. additionally, we enter into subscription service contracts
        directly with consumers which govern both our provision of and the consumers''
        payment for the tivo service. for example, consumers who activate new monthly
        subscriptions to the tivo service may be required to commit to pay for the
        tivo service for a minimum of one year or be subject to an early termination
        fee if they terminate prior to the expiration of their commitment period.
        if the terms of our subscription service contracts with consumers, such as
        our imposition of an early termination fee, or our previously offered rebate
        or gift subscription programs were to violate state or federal laws or regulations,
        we could be subject to suit, penalties, and/or negative publicity in which
        case our business would be harmed.we and the third-party vendors we work with
        will need to remain compliant with the payment card industry requirements
        for security and protection of customer credit card information and an inability
        to do so by us or our third-party vendors will adversely affect our business.as
        a merchant who processes credit card payments from its customers, we are required
        to comply with the payment card industry requirements imposed on us for the
        protection and security of our customers'' credit card information. if we
        are unable to successfully remain compliant with the payment card industry
        requirements 30table of contentsimposed on us as a credit card merchant, our
        business would be harmed because we could be prevented in the future from
        transacting customer subscription payments by means of a credit card.we need
        to safeguard the security and privacy of our subscribers'' confidential data
        and remain in compliance with laws that govern such data, and any inability
        to do so may harm our reputation and brand and expose us to legal action.uncertainty
        in the marketplace regarding the use of data from our subscribers could reduce
        demand for the tivo service and result in increased expenses. consumers may
        be concerned about the use of viewing information gathered by the tivo service
        and the dvr. currently, we gather anonymous information about our customers''
        viewing choices while using the tivo service, unless a customer affirmatively
        consents to the collection of personally identifiable viewing information.
        this anonymous viewing information does not identify the individual customer.
        privacy concerns, however, could create uncertainty in the marketplace for
        digital video recording and for our products and services. changes in our
        privacy policy could reduce demand for the tivo service, increase the cost
        of doing business as a result of privacy related litigation costs or increased
        service delivery costs, or otherwise harm our reputation and business.the
        dvr collects and stores viewer preferences and other data that many of our
        customers consider confidential. if our technological security measures are
        compromised, our customers may curtail or stop use of our products and services.
        the tivo service and tivo products such as dvrs may contain the private information
        of our customers, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss
        of this information, which could result in potential liability and litigation.
        like all services that connect with the internet, our service, including our
        website, is vulnerable to break-ins, attacks, attempts to overload our servers
        with denial-of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized
        use of our computer systems, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays,
        or shutdowns of our service, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized
        disclosure or use of personally identifiable or other confidential information.
        if we experience compromises to our security that result in service and website
        performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our service
        or website, or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information,
        our customers may lose trust and confidence in us, and decrease or discontinue
        their use of our service. further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently
        induce employees to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access
        to our information or our customers'' information. it is also possible that
        one of our employees who has access to our information or our customer''s
        information as part of his or her employment or who could attempt to gain
        unauthorized access to our information or our customer''s information and
        use it in violation of our internal policies and procedures. because the techniques
        used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage
        systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against
        a target, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement
        adequate preventative measures from either external or internal threats. we
        may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security
        breaches or to remedy problems caused by any breaches. additionally, the laws
        governing such data are constantly changing and evolving and we must comply
        with these laws or our business, including our reputation, brand and financial
        results will be harmed. failure to protect our information and our customer''s
        information from external or internal threats could negatively impact our
        ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to cancel their
        subscriptions, cause commercial partners to cease doing business with us,
        subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities,
        thereby harming our business and operating results.legislation, laws or regulations
        relating to environmental issues, employment matters, and unclaimed property
        may adversely impact our business in the future.it is possible that future
        proposed environmental regulations on consumer electronic devices, such as
        dvrs and set-top boxes, may regulate and increase the production, manufacture,
        use, and disposal costs incurred by us and our customers. for example, the
        energy independence and security act of 2007 directs the department of energy
        to prescribe labeling or other disclosure requirements for the energy use
        of standalone digital video recorder boxes. this and future energy regulations
        could potentially make it more costly for us to design, manufacture, and sell
        our dvrs to our customers thus harming the growth of our business.additionally,
        as our business grows and we expand our employed and contracted work force,
        employment laws and regulations will have an increasing impact on our ability
        to manage and grow our work-force. regulations and laws relating to the status
        of contractors, classification and related benefits for exempt and non-exempt
        employees all may adversely impact our business if we are unable to properly
        manage and comply with federal, state, and local laws.furthermore, as part
        of our regular business activities now, and in the past, we engage in the
        issuance of gift subscriptions and the marketing of rebate offers related
        to the sale of our products and services. it is possible that 31table of contentsmoney
        received by us for the sale of gift subscriptions or related to our past rebate
        offers could be subject to state and federal escheat, or unclaimed property,
        laws in the future. if this were the case, our business could be adversely
        impacted.if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the
        collection of sales tax and payment of income taxes in the various states
        in which we do business, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses,
        penalties, and fees as a result of our noncompliance in which case our business
        could be harmed.as our business grows and expands, we have started to do business
        in an increasing number of states nationally. by engaging in business activities
        in these states, we become subject to their various laws and regulations,
        including requirements to collect sales tax from our sales within those states
        and the payment of income taxes on revenue generated from activities in those
        states. the laws and regulations governing the collection of sales tax and
        payment of income taxes are numerous, complex, and vary among states. if we
        fail to comply with these laws and regulations requiring the collection of
        sales tax and payment of income taxes in one or more states where we do business,
        we could be subject to significant costs, expenses, penalties, and fees in
        which case our business would be harmed.we are subject to the foreign corrupt
        practices act (\u201cfcpa\u201d), and our failure to comply with the laws
        and regulations there under could result in penalties which could harm our
        reputation, business, and financial condition.we are subject to the fcpa,
        which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper
        payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business.
        the fcpa also requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal
        accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company.
        under the fcpa, u.s. companies may be held liable for actions taken by their
        strategic or local partners or representatives. the fcpa and similar laws
        in other countries can impose civil and criminal penalties for violations.if
        we do not properly implement practices and controls with respect to compliance
        with the fcpa and similar laws, or if we fail to enforce those practices and
        controls properly, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, including administrative
        costs related to governmental and internal investigations, civil and criminal
        penalties, injunctions and restrictions on our business activities, all of
        which could harm our reputation, business and financial condition.our certificate
        of incorporation, bylaws and delaware law could discourage a third-party from
        acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of our common stock.in
        the future, we could become the subject of an unsolicited attempted takeover
        of our company. although an unsolicited takeover could be in the best interests
        of our stockholders, certain provisions of delaware law and our organizational
        documents could be impediments to such a takeover. we are subject to the provisions
        of section\u00a0203 of the delaware general corporation law, an anti-takeover
        law. in general, the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation
        from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for
        a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person
        became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved
        in a prescribed manner. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
        and amended and restated bylaws also require that any action required or permitted
        to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or
        special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in
        writing. in addition, special meetings of our stockholders may be called only
        by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, the chairman of
        the board, our chief executive officer or the holders of 50% or more of our
        common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended
        and restated bylaws also provide that directors may be removed only for cause
        by a vote of a majority of the stockholders and that vacancies on the board
        of directors created either by resignation, death, disqualification, removal
        or by an increase in the size of the board of directors may be filled by a
        majority of the directors in office, although less than a quorum. our amended
        and restated certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board
        of directors and specifies that the authorized number of directors may be
        changed only by resolution of the board of directors.\u00a0these provisions
        of delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
        amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for us to be acquired
        by another company, even if our acquisition is in the best interests of our
        stockholders. any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in
        management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.in
        the future, our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly,
        which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.32table of
        contentswe expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly
        due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. therefore,
        you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of results of operations
        as an indication of our future performance. it is possible that in some periods
        our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and
        investors. in such event, the market price of our common stock would likely
        fall.factors that may affect our annual operating results include:\u2022demand
        for tivo-enabled dvrs and the tivo service;\u2022the timing and introduction
        of new services and features on the tivo service;\u2022seasonality and other
        consumer and advertising trends;\u2022entering into new or terminating existing
        strategic partnerships;\u2022timing of the roll-out of the tivo service and
        delivery of customized set-top boxes to our strategic partners;\u2022changes
        in our pricing policies, the pricing policies of our competitors and general
        pricing trends in the consumer electronics market;\u2022timing of revenue
        recognition under our agreements;\u2022loss of subscriptions to the tivo service;\u2022recruiting
        and retention of key personnel; and\u2022general economic conditions.\u00a0because
        our expenses precede associated revenues, unanticipated shortfalls in revenues
        could adversely affect our results of operations for any given period and
        cause the market price of our common stock to fall.seasonal trends may cause
        our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and our inability to forecast
        these trends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.consumer
        electronic product sales have traditionally been much higher during the holiday
        shopping season than during other times of the year. although predicting consumer
        demand for our products is very difficult, we have experienced that sales
        of dvrs and new subscriptions to the tivo service have been higher during
        the holiday shopping season when compared to other times of the year. if we
        are unable to accurately forecast and respond to consumer demand for our products,
        our reputation and brand will suffer and the market price of our common stock
        would likely fall.we expect that a portion of our future revenues will come
        from targeted commercials and other forms of interactive television advertising
        enabled by the tivo service. expenditures by advertisers tend to be seasonal
        and cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting
        and buying patterns. a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or
        the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers'' spending
        priorities or increase the time it takes to close a sale with our advertisers,
        which could cause our revenues from advertisements to decline significantly
        in any given period.the large number of shares available for future sale could
        adversely affect the market price for our stock.sales of a substantial number
        of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that
        such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common
        stock. several of our stockholders own a substantial number of our shares.as
        of january 31, 2014, options to purchase a total of 7,664,290 shares and 4,786,985

        1.business  our business our visionviggle makes entertainment more rewarding.
        our strategyviggle is a mobile and web-based entertainment marketing platform
        that uses incentives to make content consumption and discovery more rewarding
        for media companies, brands and consumers.  viggle helps guide consumers towards
        various forms of media consumption with television enhancement, music discovery,
        entertainment content publishing and distributed viewing reminders.  viggle
        helps consumers decide what to watch and when, broadens the viewing experience
        with real time games and additional content, and rewards viewers for being
        loyal to their favorite shows throughout a season, allowing them to earn points.  for
        brands, viggle provides advertising clients with targeted interactive ads
        to amplify their tv messaging to verified audiences.  for  media companies,
        viggle delivers promotional benefits by driving viewers to specific shows,
        engaging them in a richer content experience, and increasing awareness of
        promoted shows through web, mobile and social channels.2our content website,
        wetpaint.com, extends our promotional capabilities by reaching potential viewers
        before a tv show is broadcast and by allowing viewers to continue the conversation
        with additional show coverage after the broadcast date.  we also have technology
        that helps consumers search for media and set reminders to watch their favorite
        tv shows and movies wherever they are offered.\u00a0 in addition, we recently
        launched our music service, which allows consumers to check-in to songs on
        viggle and also earn points.   as a media company, we seek to attract a significant
        and growing audience in order to sell advertising.  we believe that making
        entertainment more rewarding and engaging for consumers will drive them to
        use viggle. overview of our serviceu.s. consumers can become viggle users
        through a free app that works on multiple types of mobile phones and tablets
        and is distributed through the apple app store and the google play store.
        after a consumer downloads the app, he or she must create an account.  viggle
        then allows consumers to play along with tv shows,  share comments through
        social media, answer trivia questions or polls, chat with friends, play games,
        or discover more about the show, all while watching tv. users can also use
        the application to discover new music. the app can listen to a song and identify
        it and allow users to build playlists and purchase the music. all of this
        activity earns users points they can redeem for real rewards.\u00a0through
        wetpaint.com, we report original news stories and publish information content  covering
        top television shows, music, celebrities, entertainment news and fashion.  wetpaint
        publishes more than 150 new articles, videos and galleries each day.  we generate
        revenues through wetpaint.com by displaying advertisements to wetpaint.com
        users as they view its content.  the viggle user experience is simple. while
        watching tv or listening to music, a user taps the \u201ccheck-in\u201d button,
        which activates the device\u2019s microphone. viggle collects an audio sample
        of the content the user can hear and uses technology to convert that sample
        into a digital fingerprint. within seconds, that digital fingerprint is matched
        against a database of reference fingerprints that are collected from at least
        190 english and spanish television channels within the united states and over
        20 million songs. we are able to verify tv check-ins across broadcast, cable,
        online, satellite, time-shifted and on-demand content as well as most songs
        cataloged on apple\u2019s itunes music library.  the ability to verify check-ins
        is critical because users are rewarded with points for each check-in and engagement
        (defined as a poll, video quiz, game or slide show).  users can redeem the
        points within the rewards catalog for items that have a monetary value such
        as unique deals and offers, products, sweepstakes, charitable donations, select
        retail gift cards and viggle-branded and other merchandise. once a user has
        \u201cchecked-in\u201d to content, the app provides a set of optional games,
        tools, and information to enhance the consumer experience.viggle points can
        be earned through six different activities within the app: watchpoints (1
        point for every minute a user is checked-in on viggle tv), bonus points (added
        points for connecting with promoted content), live engagement points (points
        earned for playing myguy, viggle live or other games), streaks and quests
        (added points for connecting with a series of shows or songs), music match
        points (points earned for matching a song on viggle), and advertising points
        (advertising revenue we share with our customers in the form of points).  viggle
        points can also be earned by engaging in entertainment content on wetpaint''s
        websites.\u00a0from the launch of the viggle app on january 25, 2012, and
        through june 30, 2014, 5,560,828 users have registered for viggle, of which
        we have deactivated 207,559 for a total of 5,353,269 registered users. for
        the three months ended june 30, 2014, we had an average of 653,419 monthly
        active users. monthly active users are computed by determining those users
        that have logged in to the viggle app at any time during the month.\u00a0
        as of june 30, 2014, our members have checked in to 403,181,838, tv programs
        and more than 50,000,000 songs and spent an average of 64 minutes and 8 seconds
        of active time within the viggle app per session.\u00a0 over 354,000 users
        have tagged a song in the viggle app. our rewards catalog consists of a variety
        of deals, sweepstakes, products, digital entertainment, viggle merchandise
        (such as t-shirts) and select retail gift cards.  users may redeem points
        for song downloads from over 7 million titles, including, for example, billy
        joel''s \"the longest time\" for 3,500 points.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0users may
        also redeem 5,000 points for a 10% discount with certain retailers, redeem
        points to participate in sweepstakes for a chance to win brand name merchandise,
        or redeem 37,000 points for a viggle t-shirt. from time to time, we may change
        the rewards offered and the number of points required to earn any given reward.\u00a0
        as of june 30, 2014, users have earned over  1.1 billion points through viggle''s
        new music service.  as of june 30, 2014 users have redeemed over 40 billion
        points for a total of 3,146,276 rewards, for an average of 12,981 points per
        reward redemption.  the total retail value of rewards redeemed through june
        30, 2014 is approximately $19.3 million.it is not possible for a user to earn
        points on the viggle app without registering.  in order to avoid double-counting
        and limit instances of fraud, the app is limited to five accounts per device
        (so as to allow for use by family members sharing a device), users are limited
        to a maximum of 6,000 points per day, users may receive points for matching
        to a song only once, users are limited to receive points for up to 20 music
        matches per day, and users are not able to share or combine points with different
        users or devices.  while it is possible for users to establish multiple accounts
        which could overstate our actual number of registered 3active users and permit
        those fraudulent users to attempt to evade our rules in an effort to accumulate
        excess points by checking-in to tv shows at the same time on different devices,
        we monitor for such activity and, when discovered, take corrective action
        according to our published terms and conditions.  registration is not required
        to access any of wetpaint''s websites.wetpaint operates media properties that
        attracted approximately 12.5 million unique monthly users in june 2014 and
        have a combined social reach of over 8.9 million facebook \u201clikes\u201d
        and follows on twitter.  for wetpaint, we define a monthly unique user as
        any visitor who has accessed wetpaint through its websites or mobile websites
        in the month of measurement, as measured by google analytics. we define total
        reach as the total amount of registered users for viggle and unique monthly
        users of the wetpaint media properties.  we define total active reach as the
        amount of monthly active users for the viggle app and the cumulative number
        of times people have \u201cliked\u201d a wetpaint page on facebook, plus the
        cumulative number of times people have \u201cfollowed\u201d a wetpaint account
        on twitter.  our total reach and total active reach for june 2014 was approximately
        18.4 million and 9.4 million, respectively.our technology the first version
        of the viggle app was approved by apple and launched to the public in the
        apple itunes app store on january 25, 2012.  it has been updated periodically.  the
        approved version of the app works on apple ios devices such as the iphone,
        ipad and ipod touch. on june 27, 2012, we released a version of the app for
        use on android smartphones and tablets. there is no guarantee as to how effectively
        the technology will perform. we continuously test and update the app with
        a goal of improving overall performance and usability. in order to insure
        the best user experience, viggle requires a device operating system of ios
        5.0 or later for apple devices or android 2.3.3 or later for android devices.
        it may become necessary to change the minimum required operating systems in
        the future.\u00a0we will consider adding versions for other mainstream mobile
        operating systems such as windows phone and blackberry based on demand and
        other business factors.  distribution of the product will occur via regular
        online marketplaces for content and applications used by such mobile operating
        systems, and will include the apple app store for ios devices or the android
        marketplace for devices using the android operating system.\u00a0the back-end
        technology for our app has been designed to accommodate the significant numbers
        of simultaneous check-ins required to support prime time television audiences.  this
        back-end technology has the capacity to support simultaneous check-ins around
        major television and music events such as the super bowl.  in addition to
        maintaining dedicated facilities, we are using third-party cloud computing
        services from amazon web services to help us scale our audio recognition capacity
        as efficiently as possible.the wetpaint entertainment website was launched
        in 2010 with the goal of providing a unique voice to the coverage of entertainment
        and celebrities.  in order to build and develop an audience for wetpaint\u2019s
        proprietary content, wetpaint has developed an audience development engine,
        which is called the social publishing platform.  the social publishing platform
        is designed to generate fans on wetpaint\u2019s pages on facebook and other
        social media outlets.  wetpaint content is then displayed in the fans\u2019
        feeds on facebook and other social media sites, which can then drive traffic
        to wetpaint\u2019s websites.   the social publishing platform contains a test
        and measurement system that delivers real-time audience insights, and provides
        optimized distribution by audience. our revenueswe began generating revenues
        in early calendar year 2012.   advertising is displayed in the viggle app
        and on the wetpaint.com websites.  we generate advertising revenue on all
        of our applications and websites, including viggle and wetpaint.com, in two
        primary ways.   first, we maintain a dedicated sales team which sells advertising
        directly to brand advertisers and television networks and to advertising agencies
        that represent brand advertisers and television networks.  second, we also
        generate revenue through our relationships with third party mobile advertising
        networks, including adcolony, tremor and yume.  these third party mobile advertising
        networks have relationships with advertisers to publish their advertisements
        on various publisher websites and mobile applications, including ours.  our
        focus is on brand marketers that are most relevant to our target demographic
        of consumers between the ages of 18 and 49, and are active in television,
        digital and retail marketing.  we generate revenue from standard mobile media
        advertising sales and affiliate programs: \u2022when our users click and view
        advertisements in our app or on our wetpaint websites; \u2022when a tv network
        or brand pays to have a particular show promoted either for a one-time airing
        or throughout a season;4\u2022when our users complete an engagement appearing
        in our app that is created by an advertising agency, our brand partners or
        our team; and \u2022through affiliate or bounty commissions to third parties
        if our users purchase items or subscribe to services after clicking from our
        app to other apps or websites.\u00a0\u00a0with the exception of one-time sponsorships
        with advertisers (which are charged a separate and specific fee), all advertising
        is serviced via a third-party advertising server for billing and verification
        purposes. revenues are generated by measuring delivered impressions on a cost
        per thousand (cpm) basis and completed engagements on a cost per engagement
        (cpe) basis.  our sales team contracts with brand advertisers to deliver a
        specific number of impressions and/or engagements for a specific price per
        thousand impressions and/or per completed engagement.  the third-party ad
        server then serves the ads and/or engagements within the app during the course
        of using the viggle app or visiting content on wetpaint.com''s websites.  as
        impressions and engagements are delivered and completed, we bill brand partners
        or advertising agencies on a monthly basis for the media delivered at our
        contracted rates.in addition to generating revenue from standard mobile media
        advertising and affiliate programs, from time to time we may also generate
        revenue from licensing our proprietary audio recognition software and related
        loyalty platform.  on march 10, 2014, we entered into a software license and
        services agreement with sfx, a company affiliated with mr. sillerman, the
        first license agreement that we have entered into for our audio recognition
        software and related loyalty program.   pursuant to the terms of the license
        agreement, sfx paid us $5,000 to license our audio recognition software and
        related loyalty platform for a term of ten years.  \u00a0our target consumerswhile
        most people watch television and listen to music, we are targeting male and
        female consumers between the ages of 18 and 49.  this target audience was
        selected due to the amount of tv and music they consume on a weekly basis,
        as well as the likelihood that they will have smartphones and other wireless
        devices such as tablets and laptops with them while consuming entertainment.
        to continue to build our user base, we will target this audience using traditional
        media techniques such as direct response, banner and mobile advertising, public
        relations, search engine optimization and search engine marketing across online,
        broadcast and print media outlets. \u00a0when a user signs up for and downloads
        our app, we collect the user\u2019s email, zip code, television provider and
        date of birth. the email enables us to verify the user and reduces the chance
        of fraud. the zip code allows us to present a relevant list of cable and satellite
        providers to the user to deliver the correct channel listing data. knowing
        the television provider in turn helps us to increase the rate of success for
        television show matching. we encourage users to provide additional information
        such as their physical mailing address.  knowing a user\u2019s birthday allows
        us to verify that the user is at least 13 years old. the physical mailing
        address is required for the delivery of physical goods selected by a user
        in the app rewards catalog.  this information also helps us better target
        relevant advertising to the user. we manage this information in adherence
        with standard privacy policies and regulations.we generate content for wetpaint.com
        that appeals largely to women between the ages of 18 and 49.  our coverage
        of tv shows and celebrities strives to attract repeat visitors to the website
        that want to read about the latest entertainment news.  we use our audience
        development engine, which is called the social publishing platform, to capture
        and distribute to facebook fans, so that our content will appear in facebook
        feeds, and generate traffic to our websites. our competitive positionthe market
        for digital and social media applications is intensely competitive and subject
        to rapid change.  new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at
        relatively low cost.  many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with
        multiple digital brands and products and can easily shift consumption from
        one provider to another. additionally, the \u201csocial tv\u201d category
        is nascent and has yet to attract the attention of mainstream consumers and
        marketers.  many of our competitors are larger, more established and better
        funded and have a history of successful operations.  although we launched
        the first version of our app in january 2012, there can be no assurance of
        how successful the product will be or how effectively the technology will
        perform.\u00a0while there are a variety of companies currently in the market
        that offer either manual check-in or audio verification, we believe our app
        differs significantly because we offer users real, as opposed to virtual,
        rewards such as unique deals and offers, electronics, sweepstakes, charitable
        donations, select retail gift cards and viggle-branded merchandise, and we
        drive our customers to engage and interact with tv shows for longer periods
        of time.  we offer a comprehensive range of features and functionality, such
        as automatic check-ins using audio verification, in-app digital advertising
        engagements (such as games or videos, real-time polls and quizzes) and full
        social media integration that reward our users for being more loyal to their
        tv shows and provides our users with, we believe, more enjoyment at the same
        time. such integration makes it easy for users to share what they are doing
        within the app with their social network and to follow show-specific commentary
        on twitter and facebook. we also offer users a listing 5of current and upcoming
        shows for which they can set reminders, learn more information and indicate
        their support of the show by \u201cliking\u201d it.  \u00a0other companies
        in the \u201csocial tv\u201d market focus on the simple ability of a user
        to communicate their television viewing activity to others in the user\u2019s
        social media circles.  instead of real rewards, these companies offer their
        users virtual points, leader board status, digital badges or stickers. we
        believe that our target market will be motivated by the ability to earn real
        rewards on a frequent basis and to interact in real time via show-specific
        polls, quizzes, videos and games.the mobile marketing industrythe media industry
        has become increasingly fragmented, with more choices than ever and with new
        models of media consumption. according to emarketer, in august 2013, 63% of
        media consumed by users was not television, with mobile representing 20% of
        consumption.according to data from experian marketing services, u.s. consumers
        are now spending more than 58 minutes a day on their smartphones for a variety
        of activities including talking, texting, social networking, emailing, visiting
        websites and playing games.  the emergence and growth of mobile devices has
        led to the \u201calways connected consumer\u201d, and advertisers continue
        to search for ways to engage with this audience.  advertisers are spending
        considerable sums of money to target the mobile user.  for example, according
        to emarketer, while television advertising is expected to continue to grow,
        from $60 billion in 2011 to $70 billion in 2017, its share of the advertising
        market is expected to decrease to 40% over that time. on the other hand, according
        to emarketer, mobile advertising is expected to expand from $1.6 billion in
        2011 to $31 billion in 2017, and its share of the advertising market is also
        expected to increase from 1% to 12% over that time.the ways in which consumers
        are using their smartphones and tablets have changed in recent years with
        the growth in usage of apps, self-contained software programs specifically
        made for mobile devices. according to flurry analytics, the average number
        of apps used on a daily basis continues to grow, measuring 7.9 in the fourth
        quarter of 2012 compared to 7.2 in the fourth quarter of 2010. the emergence
        of the app marketplace has created a unique opportunity and challenge for
        developers and advertisers to monetize the usage by consumers.the challenge
        presented with mobile advertising is that users can find the mobile advertising
        experience interruptive. while click-through banner ads are popular on web
        browsers, there is a higher degree of consumer engagement with watching an
        ad or interacting with an ad, and smart phone users expect more for their
        behavior. according to a december 2012 study conducted by forrester consulting
        on behalf of tapjoy, a mobile advertising and publishing platform, 59% of
        smartphone users agreed that if they have to see ads while using an app, they
        would prefer to be offered a reward in exchange for watching or interacting
        with the ad.  rewards programs influence consumer behavior and drive recurring
        revenue in other industries, including the consumer retail, hospitality and
        financial services industries.  in 2013, according to colloquy, the average
        household participated in 20 reward or loyalty programs.recent developmentsacquisition
        of choose digitalon june 24, 2014, we acquired choose digital inc. (\"choose
        digital\"), a miami, florida based, digital marketplace platform that allows
        companies to incorporate digital content into existing rewards and loyalty
        programs in support of marketing and sales initiatives.  with the acquisition,
        the choose digital platform will power digital media rewards for the viggle
        platform, including music, audio books, tv and movies, enabling viggle members
        to get free entertainment content just for enjoying their favorite tv shows
        and music.\u00a0\u00a0in connection with the merger, all outstanding shares
        of choose digital capital stock, along with certain promissory notes payable
        by choose digital, were converted into the right to receive in the aggregate
        (a) approximately 1,963,309 shares of viggle common stock (the \u201cstock
        consideration\u201d),  (b) approximately 205,761 restricted stock units, plus
        (c) a contingent payment, to be made within five business days after the first
        anniversary of the closing date, in an aggregate amount up to $4,792, depending
        on the trading price of viggle common stock at that time.\u00a0 \u00a0 acquisition
        of dijiton january 29, 2014, we acquired dijit media, inc. (\"dijit media\"),
        a san francisco-based\u00a0company\u00a0that has created technology that helps
        consumers to search for tv shows and set reminders to watch their favorite
        tv shows and movies wherever and whenever they are offered.\u00a0 the dijit
        \u201creminder button\u201d is easily embedded into any web page, mobile app,
        banner ad campaign or social 6property.  the button can be found on the web
        pages of more than 80 tv shows appearing on major networks.  we believe that
        the acquisition of dijit media will enhance our relationships with broadcast
        networks as the acquired technology combined with viggle''s ability to promote
        tv shows will give us a greater ability to promote tv shows to our user base.
        \u00a0we anticipate that dijit media will not have a material impact on our
        overall operating results in the near term.acquisition of wetpainton december
        16, 2013, we entered into an acquisition agreement with wetpaint.com, inc.
        (\"wetpaint\"), certain stockholders of wetpaint and shareholder representative
        services llc (solely in its capacity as the stockholders\u2019 agent) (\"the
        acquisition\"). the acquisition is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization
        under section 368(a) of the code.wetpaint is a seattle, washington-based internet
        company, founded in 2005, that publishes the website wetpaint entertainment
        (located at wetpaint.com), focused on entertainment news, and develops a proprietary
        technology platform, the social distribution system, that is used to provide
        analytics for its own website as well as other online publishers.  while wetpaint
        previously generated revenue both through licensing its platform and through
        the sale of advertising on its website, wetpaint ceased to conduct its licensing
        business prior to our acquisition of wetpaint, and we anticipate that all
        of wetpaint''s revenues going forward will be generated through the sale of
        advertising.in connection with the acquisition, all outstanding shares of
        wetpaint capital stock were converted into the right to receive an aggregate
        amount of cash and shares of our common stock payable as described below.
        promptly after the effective time of the acquisition, (i) $1,634 in cash (subject
        to certain adjustments for payment of certain transaction expenses by us and
        bonus and premium payments to certain wetpaint employees and stockholders)
        and $22,924 in shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments
        as described below) and $3,860 in restricted stock units were delivered to
        the holders of wetpaint capital stock in accordance with the allocation set
        forth in the merger agreement, and (ii) $4 in cash and $4,771 in shares of
        our common stock were delivered to an escrow agent to satisfy potential indemnification
        claims and cover certain expenses of the escrow agent.  the shares will be
        held in escrow for a period of twelve months after closing to satisfy any
        indemnification claims that might arise during that twelve month period, and
        if no claims arise, these shares will be distributed to the former shareholders
        of wetpaint.  there are no known indemnification claims at this time.  in
        february of 2014, (a) an aggregate amount of approximately $3,367 in cash
        (subject to certain adjustments for changes in wetpaint\u2019s net working
        capital, payment of certain transaction expenses by us and bonus and premium
        payments to certain wetpaint employees and stockholders) was delivered to
        the holders of wetpaint capital stock in accordance with the allocation set
        forth in the acquisition agreement and (b) $46 was delivered to the escrow
        agent to cover certain expenses of the escrow agent.pursuant to the terms
        of the acquisition agreement, if we completed a recapitalization on or before
        december 31, 2015, the stock consideration paid in the acquisition would be
        adjusted such that (i) if upon giving effect to a recapitalization, the shares
        constituting such stock consideration collectively represented less than 13.17%
        of the total outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully-diluted basis
        (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the merger agreement), we would
        issue to our stockholders that are former stockholders of wetpaint (the \u201cwetpaint/viggle
        holders\u201d) the additional number of shares of our common stock as is necessary
        such that the shares constituting the stock consideration, as so adjusted,
        represented 13.17% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock on
        a fully-diluted basis (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the merger
        agreement) as of such time, and (ii) if upon giving effect to a recapitalization,
        the shares constituting the stock consideration collectively represented greater
        than 17.55% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully-diluted
        basis (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the merger agreement),
        then we will cancel such number of shares of our common stock constituting
        the stock consideration as is necessary such that the stock consideration,
        as so adjusted, collectively represented 17.55% of the total outstanding shares
        of our common stock on a fully-diluted basis (subject to certain adjustments
        set forth in the merger agreement) as of such time.  in connection with the
        public offering and a recapitalization described below, on april 30, 2014,
        the company issued approximately 700,000 shares of common stock and approximately
        98,000 restricted stock units to the former shareholders of wetpaint.the operating
        results for each acquisition are included in our consolidated operating results
        from the date of acquisition through june 30, 2014. reverse stock spliton
        march 19, 2014, we effected a 1-for-80 reverse stock split of our outstanding
        shares of common stock.  all information in this filing on form 10-k gives
        effect to the 1-for-80 reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares
        of common stock, options and warrants. 7public offeringon april 30, 2014,
        the company closed an underwritten public offering of 4,375,000 shares of
        its common stock at a price of $8.00 per share, resulting in approximately
        $31,800 of net proceeds.  the offering was made pursuant to a registration
        statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission which
        became effective on april 24, 2014.recapitalizationon march 24, 2014, the
        company entered into exchange agreements with each of the holders of its series

        and series b convertible preferred stock (\u201cseries b preferred stock\u201d),
        pursuant to which each of the holders agreed to exchange their shares of series
        a preferred stock and series b preferred stock on the terms described in the
        exchange agreements (the \u201cexchange\u201d). consummation of the exchange
        was contingent upon the completion of the closing of a public offering of
        the company\u2019s equity securities pursuant to a registration statement
        on form s-1 through which the company raised at least $20,000 in net cash
        proceeds.  immediately prior to the completion of the exchange, the holders
        of the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock, including affiliates
        of mr. sillerman, held 34,275 shares of series a preferred stock and 21,804.2
        shares of series b preferred stock. on april 30, 2014, those shares were exchanged
        for a total of 7,151,284 shares of the company\u2019s common stock.  intellectual

        1a.risk factors\u00a0various portions of this report contain forward-looking
        statements that involve risks and uncertainties. actual results, performance
        or achievements could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
        statements as a result of certain risk factors, including those set forth
        below and elsewhere in this report (amounts in thousands, except share data).8we
        have a history of losses, expect future loses and cannot assure you that we
        will achieve profitability.we have incurred significant net losses and negative
        cash flow from operations since our inception.  we incurred net losses of
        $91,403 and $68,477 for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2013 and june 30,
        2014, respectively. as of june 30, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of
        approximately $288,862.  although our revenue has grown significantly since
        inception, we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we
        will be able to sustain our current revenue growth rate or realize sufficient
        revenue to achieve profitability.  our ability to continue as a going concern
        is dependent upon raising capital from financing transactions, increasing
        revenue throughout the year and keeping operating expenses below our revenue
        levels in order to achieve positive cash flows, none of which can be assured.  if
        we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.our independent
        registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph
        that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
        concern.\u00a0the report of our independent registered public accounting firm
        contained elsewhere in this filing for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2014
        contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our
        ability to remain a going concern because we have suffered recurring losses
        from operations and, at june 30, 2014 and 2013, had deficiencies in working
        capital.  we are unlikely to pay dividends or generate significant revenues
        or earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. the continuation of our
        company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support
        from our largest stockholders and the ability of our company to obtain necessary
        equity and debt financing to continue development of our business and to generate
        revenue.  management intends to raise additional funds through equity and
        debt offerings until sustainable revenues are developed. no assurance can
        be given that such equity and debt offerings will be successful or that development
        of our business will continue successfully.if we are unable to successfully
        develop and market our products or features or our products or features do
        not perform as expected, our business and financial condition will be adversely
        affected.\u00a0with the release of any new product or any new features to
        an existing product, we are subject to the risks generally associated with
        new product or feature introductions and applications, including lack of market
        acceptance, delays in development and implementation, and failure of new products
        or features to perform as expected. in order to introduce and market new or
        enhanced products or features successfully with minimal disruption in customer
        purchasing patterns and user experiences, we must manage the transition from
        existing products in the market. there can be no assurance that we will successfully
        develop and market, on a timely basis, products, product enhancements or features
        that respond to technological advances by others, that our new products will
        adequately address the changing needs of the market or that we will successfully
        manage product transitions. further, failure to generate sufficient cash from
        operations or financing activities to develop or obtain improved products
        and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
        and financial condition.\u00a0in addition, our technology is under continual
        development. while certain aspects of the product may currently be functioning
        on a basic level, we must perform more testing to ensure that the different
        components work together effectively and the audio sampling and matching technology
        being developed by us is accurate, performs well and integrates with metadata
        and points systems.  although the product has been launched for use on apple
        ios and android devices, there is no assurance that the product will generate
        sufficient income from brand and network advertisers, which could have a material
        adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.we distribute
        our products on apple\u2019s ios and google\u2019s android platforms, and
        if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with each of apple and google
        or if the apple app store or the google play store were unavailable for any
        prolonged period of time, our business will suffer.we distribute our products
        on apple\u2019s ios and google\u2019s android platforms. we believe that we
        have maintained a good relationship with both apple and google, but any deterioration
        in our relationship with either apple or google would materially harm our
        business and likely cause our stock price to decline. we are subject to each
        of apple\u2019s and google\u2019s standard terms and conditions for application
        developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of applications
        on their respective storefronts. each of apple and google has broad discretion
        to change its standard terms and conditions at any time. in addition, these
        standard terms and conditions can be vague and subject to changing interpretations
        by apple or google. any change in these standard terms and conditions, or
        in apple\u2019s or google\u2019s interpretation of these standard terms and
        conditions, could materially harm our business, and we may not receive any
        advance warning of such change. in addition, each of apple and google have
        the right to prohibit a developer from distributing its applications on its
        storefront if the developer violates its standard terms and conditions. in
        the event that either apple or google ever determines that we are in violation
        of its standard terms and conditions, including by a new 9interpretation,
        and prohibits us from distributing our applications on its storefront, it
        would materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to significantly
        decline. we also rely on the continued function of the apple app store and
        the google play store, as we distribute our products exclusively through these
        two digital storefronts. there have been occasions in the past when these
        digital storefronts were unavailable for short periods of time. in the event
        that either the apple app store or the google play store is unavailable for
        a prolonged period of time, it would have a material adverse effect on our
        revenues and operating results.we may seek to raise additional funds, finance
        acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing capital stock that
        would dilute your ownership.we have financed our operations, and we expect
        to continue to finance our operations and acquisitions and to develop strategic
        relationships, by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could
        significantly reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders.
        furthermore, any newly issued securities could have rights, preferences and
        privileges senior to those of our existing common stock. moreover, any issuances
        by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price
        of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership
        interest, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
        we may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or the issuance
        or sale of other securities or instruments senior to our common stock. the
        holders of any debt securities or instruments we may issue would likely have
        rights superior to the rights of our common stockholders.since we are controlled
        by our current insiders and their affiliates, you and our other non-management
        stockholders will be unable to affect the outcome in matters requiring stockholder
        approval.as of august 1, 2014, approximately 8,240,565 shares of our common
        stock, not including warrants, options, or other rights to acquire common
        stock, are owned and/or controlled by robert f.x. sillerman, our executive
        chairman, chief executive officer, director, and principal stockholder, his
        affiliates, and current affiliates and insiders.  accordingly, mr. sillerman
        and current affiliates and insiders collectively control approximately 52.3%
        of the total voting power of our shares, with mr. sillerman directly or indirectly
        beneficially owning more than a majority of the outstanding shares of common
        stock.  as a result, mr. sillerman essentially has the ability to elect all
        of our directors and to approve any action requiring stockholder action, without
        the vote of any other stockholders.  it is possible that the interests of
        mr. sillerman could conflict in certain circumstances with those of other
        stockholders.  such concentrated ownership may also make it difficult for
        our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock in
        the event we merge with a third party or enter into other transactions that
        require stockholder approval.  these provisions could also limit the price
        that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common
        stock. we rely on key members of management, and the loss of their services
        could adversely affect our success and development.our success depends on
        the expertise and continued service of mr. sillerman and certain other key
        executives and technical personnel. these individuals are a significant factor
        in our growth and ability to meet our business objectives. in particular,
        our success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers
        and our directors, particularly mr. sillerman. it may be difficult to find
        a sufficiently qualified individual to replace mr. sillerman or other key
        executives in the event of death, disability or resignation, resulting in
        our being unable to satisfactorily execute our business. the loss of one or
        more of our executive officers and directors could slow the growth of our
        business, or it may cease to operate at all, which may result in the total
        loss of an investor\u2019s investment.compensation may be paid to our executive
        officers, directors and employees regardless of our profitability, which may
        limit our ability to finance our business and adversely affect our business.mr.
        sillerman and other executive officers are receiving compensation, and other
        current and future employees of our company may be entitled to receive compensation,
        payments and reimbursements regardless of whether we operate at a profit or
        a loss. any compensation received by mr. sillerman or any other senior executive
        in the future will be determined from time to time by our board of directors
        or our compensation committee. such obligations may negatively affect our
        cash flow and our ability to finance our business, which could cause our business
        to fail.some of our executive officers and directors may have conflicts of
        interest in business opportunities that may be disadvantageous to us.mr. sillerman
        and mitchell j. nelson, our executive vice president, secretary and a director,
        are each engaged in other business endeavors, including circle entertainment
        inc. (\u201ccircle\u201d), of which mr. sillerman is a director and mr. nelson
        is an executive officer. mr. sillerman is also the chairman of sfx, a company
        in the live entertainment business. under mr. sillerman\u2019s employment
        agreement, he is obligated to devote his working time to our affairs, but
        may continue to perform his responsibilities as an executive officer of sfx
        and as a director of circle, and may be involved in other outside non-competitive
        businesses. mr. sillerman has 10agreed to present to us any business opportunities
        related to or appropriate for our business. pursuant to mr. nelson\u2019s
        employment agreement, he is obligated to devote such time and attention to
        the affairs of our company as is necessary for him to perform his duties as
        executive vice president. he is also entitled to perform similar functions
        for circle and performs general legal duties for sfx pursuant to the shared
        services agreements described in the section entitled \u201ccertain relationships
        and related transactions\u201d elsewhere in this filing on form 10-k. in addition,
        one of our directors, john miller, is a member of the board of directors of
        sfx and our newest director, michael meyer, is a member of the board of directors
        and chair of the audit committee of circle and is also a member of the board
        of directors of sfx. although circle, sfx and our company have generally different
        business plans, interests and programs, it is conceivable there may be a conflict
        of interest in determining where a potential opportunity should be brought.
        conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of corporate policy, except
        under guidelines approved by the board of directors, as set forth in our code
        of business conduct and ethics. our code of business conduct and ethics also
        sets forth the procedures to follow in the event that a potential conflict
        of interest arises.  our business and growth may suffer if we are unable to
        attract and retain key officers or employees.our ability to expand operations
        to accommodate our anticipated growth will depend on our ability to attract
        and retain qualified media, management, finance, marketing, sales and technical
        personnel. however, competition for these types of employees is intense due
        to the limited number of qualified professionals. our ability to meet our
        business development objectives will depend in part on our ability to recruit,
        train and retain top quality people with advanced skills who understand our
        technology and business. no assurance can be given that we will be successful
        in this regard. if we are unable to engage and retain the necessary personnel,
        our business may be materially and adversely affected.we are uncertain of
        our ability to manage our growth.our ability to grow our business is dependent
        upon a number of factors, including our ability to hire, train and assimilate
        management and other employees, the adequacy of our financial resources, our
        ability to identify and efficiently provide such new products and services
        as our customers may require in the future, and our ability to adapt our own
        systems to accommodate expanded operations.because of pressures from competitors
        with more resources, we may fail to implement our business strategy profitably.the
        digital and mobile technology business is highly fragmented, extremely competitive,
        and subject to rapid change. the market for customers is intensely competitive
        and such competition is expected to continue to increase. we believe that
        our ability to compete depends upon many factors within and beyond our control,
        including the timing and market acceptance of new solutions and enhancements
        to existing businesses developed by us and our competitors. we are an entertainment
        company that utilizes digital media and smartphone technology. if we are successful,
        larger and more established entertainment companies, with significantly greater
        resources, may try to enter the market with similar technologies, and may
        be in better competitive positions than we are. many consumers maintain simultaneous
        relationships with multiple digital brands and products and can easily shift
        consumption from one provider to another. our principal competitors are in
        segments such as:\u2022applications promoting social tv or music experiences
        and discussions; and\u2022white label providers of social media and media-specific
        applications.additionally, new competitors may be able to launch new businesses
        at relatively low cost.  either existing or new competitors may develop new
        technologies, and our existing and potential advertisers may shift their advertising
        expenditures to these new technologies. we cannot be sure that we will be
        able to successfully execute our business in the face of such competition.we
        may be unable to compete with larger or more established companies in two
        industries.we face a large and growing number of competitors in the digital
        and mobile technology and entertainment industries.  if we successfully combine
        digital and mobile technology with entertainment, we will have competitors
        from both the digital and mobile technology and entertainment industries.
        many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical
        and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories,
        greater name recognition, and more established relationships in these industries
        than do we. as a result, certain of these competitors may be in better positions
        to compete with us for customers and audiences. further, our current and/or
        future competitors in the digital and mobile technology industry may develop
        or license technology that is similar to the viggle app. we cannot be sure
        that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors.although
        it cannot use the technology licensed to it by us to compete with our current
        business, sfx may have the ability to compete with us in future lines of business.11although
        our license agreement with sfx does not permit sfx to use our technology in
        a manner or for applications that we believe would be competitive with our
        current or proposed operations and businesses, the license agreement does
        provide sfx with the ability to use our technology within a relatively broad
        range, which could result in sfx using our technology to compete with us in
        other businesses we may elect to pursue in the future.failure to successfully
        combine and integrate the businesses of wetpaint, dijit or choose digital
        in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results.the success
        of our acquisitions of choose digital, wetpaint and dijit will depend, in
        part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the
        businesses of  choose digital, wetpaint and dijit with our existing business.
        to realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses of choose digital, wetpaint
        and dijit must be successfully integrated and combined. if users of each of
        the choose digital, wetpaint, dijit and viggle services do not prove to have
        an affinity to the new complementary services they are introduced to, results
        of the combination could be worse than anticipated. our management may face
        significant challenges in consolidating choose digital''s, wetpaint\u2019s
        and dijit''s functions with ours, integrating the technologies, organizations,
        procedures, policies and operations, as well as addressing the different business
        cultures at the two companies, and retaining key personnel. if choose digital,
        wetpaint and dijit are not successfully integrated, the anticipated benefits
        of our acquisitions of choose digital, wetpaint and dijit may not be realized
        fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. the integration
        may also be complex and time consuming, and require substantial resources
        and effort. the integration process and other disruptions resulting from our
        acquisitions of choose digital, wetpaint and dijit may also disrupt each company\u2019s
        ongoing businesses and/or adversely affect their relationships with employees,
        users, and others with whom they have business or other dealings.since choose
        digital, wetpaint and dijit were private companies, we may be required to
        expend substantial sums in order to bring them into compliance with the various
        reporting requirements applicable to public companies and/or to prepare required
        financial statements, and such efforts may harm our operating results or be
        unsuccessful altogether. prior to our acquisitions of them, choose digital,
        wetpaint and dijit were not subject to many of the requirements applicable
        to public companies, including section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002,
        or the sarbanes-oxley act, which requires that choose digital, wetpaint and
        dijit evaluate and report on their system of internal controls.  we will need
        to evaluate and integrate the system of internal controls for choose digital,
        wetpaint and dijit. we did not conduct a formal evaluation of choose digital''s,
        wetpaint\u2019s or dijit''s internal controls over financial reporting prior
        to our acquisition of those companies. if our finance and accounting staff
        or internal controls over financial reporting are inadequate, we may be required
        to hire additional staff and incur substantial legal and accounting costs
        to address such inadequacies. moreover, we cannot be certain that our remedial
        measures will be effective. any failure to implement required or improved
        controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm
        our operating results or increase its risk of material weaknesses in internal
        controls. we will incur significant transaction and merger-related transition
        costs in connection with our acquisitions of choose digital, wetpaint and
        dijit. we expect we will incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection
        with consummating the acquisitions of choose digital, wetpaint and dijit and
        integrating the operations of those companies. we may incur additional costs
        to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. we may also incur
        significant fees and expenses relating to financing arrangements and legal,
        accounting and other transaction fees and costs associated with these acquisitions.
        if we do not continue to develop and offer compelling content, products and
        services and attract new consumers or maintain the engagement of our existing
        consumers, our advertising revenues could be adversely affected.in order to
        attract consumers and maintain or increase engagement on viggle, choose digital,
        wetpaint and dijit properties, we believe we must offer compelling content,
        products and services. acquiring, developing and offering new content, products
        and services, as well as new functionality, features and enhanced performance
        of our existing content, products and services, may require significant investment
        and time to develop. in addition, consumer tastes are difficult to predict
        and subject to rapid change.  if we are unable to develop online content,
        products and services that are attractive and relevant to viggle, choose digital,
        wetpaint and dijit users, we may not be able to maintain or increase our existing
        users\u2019 engagement on or attract new consumers to viggle, choose digital,
        wetpaint and dijit properties and as a result our search rankings, traffic
        and usage metrics, and advertising revenues may be adversely affected.our
        licensing agreement with sfx entertainment, inc. may adversely affect our
        ability to generate revenues in the future.12on march 10, 2014, we entered
        into a software license and services agreement with sfx, a company affiliated
        with mr. sillerman,  pursuant to which we licensed our audio recognition software
        and related loyalty program to sfx.  sfx may use the software for its own
        internal business purposes and may sublicense the software to its affiliates
        or to its co-promoters.  the agreement provides that during the term of the
        agreement we may not license the software to any third party that directly
        competes with sfx in the promotion of dance music.  therefore, the agreement
        will prevent us from entering into, and generating licensing revenues from,
        any third parties that compete with sfx in the promotion of dance music.  the
        agreement also provides that sfx will receive 50% of our net revenues from
        the license of the software to any third party.  accordingly, any future revenues
        that we receive from licensing the technology to third parties will be reduced.
        wetpaint relies on social media posts to drive traffic to its websites.  changes
        in rules, algorithms, and display formats of social media sites could result
        in a reduction in such traffic.wetpaint relies on posts on various social
        media platforms, including facebook and twitter, to drive users to its websites.  in
        the event that facebook or twitter changes their respective terms and conditions
        to prevent such activity by wetpaint, wetpaint\u2019s user numbers could decrease.
        further, these platforms change their algorithms and application programming
        interfaces, or api\u2019s, in the ordinary course of business, often without
        notice or explanation to publishers.  changes to these algorithms and api\u2019s
        may reduce the effectiveness of wetpaint\u2019s publishing capabilities, and
        result in temporary or permanent reductions to the net numbers of fans and
        followers added each month, as well as the rate at which wetpaint content
        is displayed to users and clicked upon.  in such cases, traffic to wetpaint
        websites could be adversely affected.wetpaint relies upon traffic from search
        engines such as google to bring an influx of website visitors each month.  search
        engine traffic is dynamic in nature, and is subject to an ever-changing mix
        of user-entered keywords, competitive offerings, and algorithmic fluctuations
        by the search engines themselves.search engines such as google represent a
        significant source of wetpaint traffic, and the originating source for many
        users who become wetpaint fans and followers on the social networks.  the
        ranking of wetpaint content in the various search engines is always changing,
        and relates to algorithmic assessments by the search engines compared to offerings
        that compete with wetpaint. the popular keywords for which wetpaint ranks
        highly could subside in their popularity, or wetpaint may fail to maintain
        the rankings that it has had for such keywords.  in addition, as new keywords
        become popular, wetpaint content may fail to rank highly for those keywords.if
        wetpaint does not maintain talent, access, and reputation among sources for
        news stories, we would lose access to stories and our traffic and revenues
        could suffer.wetpaint is reliant upon an editorial organization and freelance
        talent that secures proprietary access to stories that interest our audience.  our
        ability to identify and create content that interests the audience is dependent
        on maintaining and growing our access to talent and sources.  if we lose key
        editorial talent, or our reputation is not maintained, we could lose our ability
        to create the content that garners audience interests, and traffic and our
        revenues could be adversely affected.if our products do not achieve market
        acceptance, we may not have sufficient financial resources to fund our operations
        or further development.while we believe that a viable market exists for our
        products, there is no assurance that our technology will prove to be an attractive
        alternative to conventional or competitive products in the markets that we
        have identified. in the event that a viable market for our products cannot
        be created for our business or our products do not achieve market acceptance,
        we may need to commit greater resources than are currently available to develop
        a commercially viable and competitive product. there can be no assurance that
        we would have sufficient financial resources to fund such development or that
        such development would be successful. further, our business requires the use
        of capital resources to purchase rewards for our rewards program, as discussed
        more fully above in the section entitled \u201cthe company\u2019s 12-month
        plan for its business.\u201d  in addition, as we grow our number of monthly
        active users, our rewards costs will increase.  we will need to increase our
        revenue per monthly active user in order to cover our rewards costs and to
        become profitable; there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. additionally,
        there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient resources to fund our rewards
        program, which will have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.  in
        addition, if our products do not generate sufficient revenues, or we are unable
        to raise additional capital, we may be unable to fund our operations.  our
        ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and other
        factors, many of which are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that,
        when required, sufficient funds will be available to us on satisfactory terms.our
        business will suffer if our network systems fail or become unavailable.13a
        reduction in the performance, reliability and availability of our network
        infrastructure would harm our ability to distribute our products to our users,
        as well as our reputation and ability to attract and retain users and content
        providers. our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire,
        flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, internet breakdown, earthquake
        and similar events. our systems could also be subject to viruses, break-ins,
        sabotage, acts of terrorism, acts of vandalism, hacking, cyber-terrorism and
        similar misconduct. we might not carry adequate business interruption insurance
        to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage. any system
        error or failure that causes interruption in availability of products, or
        an increase in response time, could result in a loss of potential customers
        or content providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
        financial condition and results of operations. if we suffer sustained or repeated
        interruptions, our products and services could be less attractive to our users
        and our business would be materially harmed.if we fail to detect fraud, including
        click fraud, other invalid clicks on ads, or improper engagements, we could
        lose the confidence of our current and potential advertiser clients, incur
        additional costs, or both, which would cause our business to suffer.we are
        exposed to the risk of fraudulent and other invalid clicks or conversions
        that advertisers may perceive as undesirable or that may cost us additional
        money for points given in connection with such activity. while our terms and
        conditions limit one account per person and we have specific controls in place
        to avoid fraud, such as limiting the number of accounts allowed per device
        and the number of points per day, there is no assurance that our controls
        will be effective. as a result, estimates of our registered users, monthly
        active users or other statistical information may be inflated as there may
        be some instances of double-counting users. we are aware that some people
        will attempt to evade our rules in an effort to accumulate excess points through
        a multitude of methods including, but not limited to, establishing multiple
        accounts, mimicking app activity through \u201cscripting,\u201d and using
        multiple devices simultaneously. we monitor our users to determine if any
        are attempting to do so and consider this fraudulent activity a violation
        of our published terms and conditions. we invalidate users whom we believe
        to violate these terms and conditions and continually make efforts to improve
        our systems to detect fraud and improve our defenses. through june 30, 2014,
        we have invalidated 207,559 accounts for suspicious activity of a total of
        5,560,828 registered accounts. invalid clicks could result from inadvertent
        clicks or click fraud, where a mobile device user intentionally clicks on
        ads for reasons other than to access the underlying content of the ads. if
        fraudulent or other malicious activity is perpetrated by others, and we are
        unable to detect and prevent it, the affected advertisers may experience or
        perceive a reduced return on their investment. high levels of invalid click
        activity could lead to dissatisfaction with our advertising services, refusals
        to pay, refund demands or withdrawal of future business. if fraudulent or
        other malicious activity occurs, and we are unable to detect and prevent it,
        we could also experience increased costs relating to awarding points as a
        result of these activities. any of these occurrences could damage our brand
        and lead to a loss of advertisers and revenue and increased costs.we may be
        unable to protect our intellectual property rights from third-party claims
        and litigation, which could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention,
        and harm our business.our success is dependent in part on obtaining, maintaining
        and enforcing our proprietary rights and our ability to avoid infringing on
        the proprietary rights of others. we seek patent protection for those inventions
        and technologies for which we believe such protection is suitable and is likely
        to provide a competitive advantage to us.   because patent applications in
        the united states are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application
        is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents,
        patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products
        that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party
        products that compete with our products and processes. in the event a competitor
        or other party successfully challenges our products, processes, patents or
        licenses, or claims that we have infringed upon their intellectual property,
        we could incur substantial litigation costs defending against such claims,
        be required to pay royalties, license fees or other damages or be barred from
        using the intellectual property at issue, any of which could have a material
        adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
        we also rely substantially on trade secrets, proprietary technology, nondisclosure
        and other contractual agreements, and technical measures to protect our technology,
        application, design, and manufacturing know-how, and work actively to foster
        continuing technological innovation to maintain and protect our competitive
        position.  we cannot assure you that steps taken by us to protect our intellectual
        property and other contractual agreements for our business will be adequate,
        that our competitors will not independently develop or patent substantially
        equivalent or superior technologies or be able to design around patents that
        we may receive, or that our intellectual property will not be misappropriated.in
        addition, we use open source software in our services and will continue to
        use open source software in the future. from time to time, we may be subject
        to claims brought against companies that incorporate open source software
        into their products or services, claiming ownership of, or demanding release
        of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that
        were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms
        of the applicable open source license. these claims 14could also result in
        litigation, require us to purchase a costly license, or require us to devote
        additional research and development resources to changing our products or
        services, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and results
        of operations.we are currently a defendant in an action commenced by blue
        spike, llc, alleging patent infringement in connection with our audio recognition
        technology. we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this lawsuit.the
        sec opened a formal order of investigation relating to a matter regarding
        certain dealings in our securities by an unaffiliated third party. in addition,
        we have also received an informal request from the sec for the voluntary production
        of documents and information concerning certain aspects of our business and
        technology. although we have provided documents in response to the sec\u2019s
        request, there is no assurance that the sec will not take any action against
        us.the sec opened a formal order of investigation relating to a matter regarding
        certain dealings in our securities by an unaffiliated third party. we have
        also received an informal request from the staff of the sec, dated june 11,
        2012, for the voluntary production of documents and information concerning
        certain aspects of our business and technology. we initially provided documents
        in response to such request on july 2, 2012, and we have provided supplements
        and documents for additional questions, as requested. we intend to cooperate
        with the sec regarding this matter and any other requests we may receive.
        however, there is no assurance that the sec will not take any action against
        us. a determination by the sec to take action against us could be costly and
        time consuming, could divert the efforts and attention of our directors, officers
        and employees from the operation of our business and could result in sanctions
        against us, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our
        business and operating results.changes to federal, state or international
        laws or regulations applicable to our business could adversely affect our
        business.our business is subject to a variety of federal, state and international
        laws and regulations, including those with respect to privacy, advertising
        generally, consumer protection, content regulation, intellectual property,
        defamation, child protection, advertising to and collecting information from
        children, taxation, employment classification and billing. these laws and
        regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations,
        could change. in addition, new laws or regulations affecting our business
        could be enacted. these laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply
        with and may divert a significant portion of management\u2019s attention.
        if we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could be
        subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.there
        are many federal, state and international laws that may affect our business,
        including measures to regulate consumer privacy, the use of copyrighted material,
        the collection of certain data, network neutrality, patent protection, cyber
        security, child protection, subpoena and warrant processes, taxes and tax
        reporting (including issuing irs 1099 forms to our users), gift cards, employee
        classification, employee health care, and others. if we fail to comply with
        these applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to significant liabilities
        which could adversely affect our business.in addition, most states have enacted
        legislation governing the breach of data security in which sensitive consumer
        information is released or accessed. if we fail to comply with these applicable
        laws or regulations we could be subject to significant liabilities which could
        adversely affect our business.\u00a0many of our potential partners are subject
        to industry specific laws, regulations or licensing requirements, including
        in the following industries: pharmaceuticals, online gaming, alcohol, adult
        content, tobacco, firearms, insurance, securities brokerage, real estate,
        sweepstakes, free trial offers, automatic renewal services and legal services.
        if any of our advertising partners fail to comply with any of these licensing
        requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and
        regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise
        expanded, our business could be adversely affected. furthermore, these laws
        may also limit the way we advertise our products and services or cause us
        to incur compliance costs, which could affect our revenues and could further
        adversely impact our business.\u00a0there are a number of significant matters
        under review and discussion with respect to government regulations which may
        affect the business we intend to enter and/or harm our customers, and thereby
        adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.15our
        business has substantial indebtedness and all of our assets are subject to
        a security interest.we currently have, and will likely continue to have, a
        substantial amount of indebtedness. our indebtedness could, among other things,
        make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, require us
        to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to repay and service
        our debt or otherwise create liquidity problems, limit our flexibility to
        adjust to market conditions, place us at a competitive disadvantage and expose
        us to interest rate fluctuations. as of june 30, 2014, we had total debt outstanding
        of approximately $15.0 million. we expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses
        and pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from
        our operations and potentially from other debt or equity offerings. accordingly,
        our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance and
        capital raising activities, which will be affected by financial, business,
        economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. if our cash
        flow and capital resources prove inadequate to allow us to pay the principal
        and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations, we could face substantial
        liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or
        operations, restructure or refinance our debt, which we may be unable to do
        on acceptable terms, and forgo attractive business opportunities.  the terms
        of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any
        of these alternatives.  in addition, we are also party to a term loan agreement
        in the aggregate principal amount of $15 million.  we are party to a pledge
        and security agreement with the lender under that facility pursuant to which
        we pledged $5 million and provided a security interest in the account in which
        the funds are placed.  accordingly, we will not have access to those funds
        until all obligations under the term loan agreement are paid in full.our earnings
        are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market
        downturns.\u00a0our revenues and earnings may fluctuate significantly in the
        future.  general economic or other political conditions may cause a downturn
        in the market for our products or services.  despite the recent improvements
        in market conditions, a future downturn in the market for our products or
        services could adversely affect our operating results and increase the risk
        of substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations in our earnings. our future
        operating results may be affected by many factors, including, but not limited
        to: our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated advertisers and publishers;
        our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and services on
        a timely basis; changes in the mix of products developed, produced and sold;
        and disputes with our advertisers and publishers.\u00a0\u00a0these factors
        affecting our future earnings are difficult to forecast and could harm our
        quarterly and/or annual operating results.\u00a0public company compliance
        may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\u00a0the
        sarbanes-oxley act and new rules subsequently implemented by the sec have
        required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies.\u00a0\u00a0as
        a public company, we expect these new rules and regulations to increase our
        compliance costs in fiscal 2014 and beyond and to make certain activities
        more time consuming and costly.\u00a0\u00a0as a public company, we also expect
        that these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive
        for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and
        we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially
        higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage.\u00a0\u00a0as a result,
        it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to
        serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\u00a0if we fail
        to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may
        not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely or to prevent
        fraud. any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and
        timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of
        our common stock.effective internal control is necessary for us to provide
        reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. if we cannot provide reliable
        financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business
        as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and
        our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. we are required
        to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting.
        failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once
        established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business,
        prospects, financial condition or results of operations.", "permalink_id":

        and people. looking specifically at products, we offer a diverse portfolio
        of stb, soc and connectivity solutions that include the following:\u2022stb
        soc solutions: we added stb soc solutions to our product offering in april
        2012, when we completed the acquisition of assets related to the stb business
        of trident microsystems, inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, collectively
        trident. the stb product portfolio is composed of a comprehensive suite of
        digital stb components and system solutions for the worldwide satellite, terrestrial,
        cable and ip television, or iptv, markets. our stb products primarily consist
        of stb socs, but also include data over cable service interface specifications,
        or docsis, modems, interface devices and media processors. in addition to
        traditional standard-definition, or sd, stbs and advanced high-definition,

        odu, solutions which consist of our band translation switch, or bts, and channel
        stacking switch, or css, products which simplify the installation required
        to support simultaneous reception of multiple channels from multiple satellites
        over a single cable. our dbs odu offerings also provide an accelerated roadmap
        for our digital channel stacking switch, or dcss, semiconductor products,
        which are highly-integrated products that incorporate broadband capture and
        ip output. to further solidify our dcss roadmap, in june 2013, we acquired
        certain assets from mobius semiconductor, inc., or mobius, a leading product
        development company focused on low power, high performance analog mixed-signal
        semiconductor solutions. mobius\u2019 technology blends signal processing
        with analog circuit design to dramatically reduce power dissipation while
        attaining leading-edge performance. the addition of the mobius technology
        allows us to provide cable and satellite operators with solutions that encompass
        system designs that are low power, broadband, high-speed, and which capture
        the full bandwidth of the signal payload - to drive more entertainment streams
        and ip services to more connected devices in the home.in mid-2013, we shifted
        our internal organization structure from a product-driven company into a global
        solutions and segment-driven organization to better serve our original equipment/device
        manufacturers and pay-tv service provider customers. today, we serve five
        primary market segments with our technology: cable, satellite, telco/iptv,
        moca/ce retail and media processing. with a focused approach on each market
        segment we can understand customers\u2019 current needs and better anticipate
        future requirements, which in turn enables customers to accelerate time-to-market
        on new stb devices, as well as deploy advanced new ip- and cloud-based services
        such as video on demand, or vod, multi-room dvr, hd video calling and over-the-top,
        or ott, content delivery, to drive average revenue per user. our products
        are deployed by major service providers globally, including comcast, cox communications,
        directv, dish network, ocn (china), time warner cable, topway (china), upc
        (netherlands) and verizon, as well as by a number of smaller service providers.in
        january 2013, we unveiled a new corporate brand identity to represent the
        significant shift in our overall mission: to power the whole-home entertainment
        experience by transforming the way entertainment is delivered, connected and
        consumed in the home and on the go. the corporate logo was modernized and
        the word \"communications\" was dropped in all new marketing communications
        programs. we were incorporated in delaware in january 2001. our principal
        executive offices are located at 6290 sequence drive, san diego, california
        92121, and our telephone number is (858)\u00a0768-3600. our corporate website

        global select market under the symbol entr.industry backgroundthe delivery
        of entertainment content to the home is undergoing fundamental change as digital
        formats affect how content is delivered and consumed. the supply of advanced
        devices that decode the evolving digital formats presents the core growth
        opportunity to our business. according to ims research, the number of worldwide
        hd video consumer premise equipment (consisting of hd-digital transport adapters,
        or dtas, / stbs / gateways / media servers / hd dvrs) is expected to grow
        from 79 million in 2011 to approximately 182\u00a0million by 2015, representing
        a compound annual growth rate of approximately 23 percent. in addition to
        this core growth, service providers are making significant investments to
        differentiate their offerings and adding new video services such as video-on-demand,
        \u201cwhole-home\u201d dvr, \"networked\" dvr, as well as bundled video, voice,
        broadband data, 3g/4g/wi-fi coverage (via strategic partnerships) and other
        digitally enabled services in the areas of home automation, security and more.
        all these services also rely on the home network or \u201cip-backbone\u201d
        to provide reliable in-home connectivity with low latency and service provider
        managed quality of service, or qos. ultimately, the consumer can not only
        watch content through tvs, cell phones and tablets, but also control a variety
        of functions from temperature, lighting and ip cameras even when they are
        away from the home. of course as more services are \u201cbundled,\u201d the
        service provider becomes integral in the day-to-day life of the consumer,
        reducing subscriber turnover all the while increasing the average revenue
        per user and driving subscriber growth.  4several favorable consumer entertainment
        trends are contributing to the increasing video and multimedia revenue opportunity
        for service providers. these trends include:\u2022increasing availability
        of digital multimedia content.\u00a0\u00a0the conversion of multimedia content
        from an analog to a digital format and the increasing number of broadcast
        content providers who make their video content available for online video
        streaming are significantly increasing the amount and variety of video, music,
        photos and other multimedia content that consumers buy, receive and store.
        in north america, cable providers are moving to all-digital services to reclaim
        network bandwidth for new, advanced services, such as faster broadband tiers.
        in asia, the conversion is being driven by regulation mandates and an increase
        in competition between providers. \u2022introduction of new video formats
        requiring greater bandwidth.\u00a0\u00a0the development and introduction of
        digital video formats starting with sd and progressing to hd, three dimensional,
        or 3d, and ultra-high definition television, not only provide the consumer
        with a higher quality viewing experience, but also increase the data throughput
        by up to 16 times the current hd requirements.\u2022proliferation of connected
        digital multimedia devices within the home.\u00a0\u00a0as a result of the
        increasing availability of multimedia content from sources inside the home
        and from the internet, connected digital multimedia devices such as hdtvs,
        desktop and laptop personal computers, dvd players, tablets, blu-ray players,
        portable media players, gaming consoles, dvrs and ott stbs can now be found
        in u.s. households in increasing numbers.\u2022introduction of new multimedia
        applications.\u00a0\u00a0an increasing number of multimedia applications utilize
        digital video and other multimedia content for consumer home entertainment.
        some examples of these applications include video \u201ctime shifting,\u201d
        or the ability to pause, fast forward and rewind live or stored video, the
        ability to watch and record multiple television shows at once, video-on-demand,
        multi-room dvr or \u201cplaceshifting\u201d which enables the sharing of multimedia
        content across devices and between rooms throughout the home, online gaming,
        streaming of downloaded movies stored on a personal computer to a television,
        ip calling services such as skype, and ott services that directly deliver
        internet video content into the home. \u2022increasing consumer adoption of
        ott services.\u00a0\u00a0consumer demand for fully customizable viewing experiences
        that allow them to select the time, place and content has increased the availability
        of ott services such as those offered from apple (itunes), google (google
        play), netflix, hulu, bestbuy (cinemanow), amazon (unbox) and wall-mart (vudu),
        all of which benefit from having a high-speed, highly reliable network connection
        to digital multimedia devices, such as connected hd video and game consoles,
        within a\u00a0home.\u2022increasing number of services being provided.\u00a0\u00a0consumers
        have always envied the idea of whole-home automation, but until recently,
        has been a service only afforded by only a small portion of the population
        due to the high initial device and equipment installation costs. with the
        advent of premium services like \u201csignaturehome\u00ae\u201d service from
        time warner cable and comcast''s \u201cxfinity\u00ae signature service\u201d,
        a much larger customer base can enjoy such conveniences in addition to folding
        in home security and surveillance, all of which mandate a highly-reliable
        \u201cip-backbone\u201d within the consumer''s home. as a result, moca is
        the premier choice of \u201chome networking\u201d of the various cable and
        pay satellite devices.by providing more advanced customer premises equipment,
        service providers are able to more easily introduce new services, simplify
        and enhance the user experience, and maintain content security and service
        reliability while meeting these increasing consumer entertainment demands.we
        believe traditional cable, satellite and telco/iptv service providers will
        continue to be competitive in providing these services because of their long-standing
        licensed access and distribution rights to premium video content. in addition,
        they have established the infrastructure that enables carrier class qos and
        have developed new system in-home \u201cgateway\u201d or \u201cmedia server\u201d
        topologies to leverage the demand for changing consumer behavior. these new
        gateways or media servers in north america will connect to moca-enabled client
        devices creating a system architecture for multiple system operators with
        lower total cost of ownership than current deployments. in other countries,
        we see leading video providers considering similar client/server architectures
        as the most efficient way to deliver broadcast and broadband video. 5the stringent
        communications requirements associated with high-quality hd video, 3d video
        and other multimedia content present a significant challenge for service providers
        today. in response, service providers require solutions that enable the distribution
        of video and other multimedia content into and throughout the home, and processing
        of such content for display on televisions and other devices, while maintaining
        the high-quality standards demanded by subscribers. for any such technology
        solution to succeed, we believe it must satisfy the following requirements:\u2022high
        bandwidth, reliability and full qos for hd video.\u00a0due to the fact that
        video is typically a streaming, real-time, visual experience, video quality
        can rapidly degrade with errors or delays in packet delivery. a high-quality
        video experience requires reliable first-pass transmission, very low packet
        error rate, low latency and low jitter. moreover, video consumes up to 10
        times more bandwidth than typical voice and data services and has higher qos
        requirements. a connected home with capacity to support multiple high-quality
        hd video streams requires a high bandwidth network with net throughput in
        excess of 100 megabits per second for today''s services. in the future, we
        believe more ip-based video will be distributed around the home along with
        broadband service bandwidth, thereby increasing need for a home network that
        can support greater than 250 mbps.\u2022cost-effective deployment.\u00a0it
        is important for service providers to leverage the existing installed network
        infrastructure inside and outside the home to minimize incremental cost and
        expedite new service deployments. service providers prefer plug-and-play installation
        of new services as opposed to having to dispatch a service vehicle to customer
        premises, often referred to as a \u201ctruck roll.\u201d service providers
        are focused on saving installation time and minimizing customer service calls,
        thereby reducing total costs to deliver video services. in some cases, service
        providers may install customer premise equipment that is capable of providing
        services that are not ordered by the customer at the time of installation
        but which may be switched on remotely at a later time, thereby potentially
        avoiding the need for future truck rolls.\u2022customer ease of use.\u00a0most
        consumers have little tolerance for complicated devices and service disruptions.
        therefore, mainstream consumer adoption requires an easy to use and compelling
        service offering and plug-and-play service installation with minimal ongoing
        maintenance.\u2022co-existence with other services and devices.\u00a0consumers
        currently subscribe to a broad array of communications services, including
        traditional voice, broadcast television, broadband access and cellular wireless
        services that are delivered using a number of different technologies. in addition,
        consumers may use a multitude of computing, communications and consumer electronics
        devices, such as personal computers, video players, gaming consoles, stbs
        and televisions. any successful home networking or access solution must seamlessly
        co-exist with existing services and devices with minimal interference or degradation
        in performance.\u2022security.\u00a0the ability to ensure the secure delivery
        of content and consumer privacy is an essential element of any successful
        bundled service offering. therefore, home networking and access solutions
        require robust data encryption and other security mechanisms to be considered
        viable. service providers have multiple security technology options to choose
        from in the market today.to address these requirements and find ways to increase

        socs identified on our roadmap, we will move to a higher level of integration
        of discrete components into our socs. this is primarily focused on integrating
        moca 2.0 from our connectivity business to address the growing needs of north
        american cable and satellite operators. we have also been working on high
        efficiency video codec, which is the next evolution of the mpeg video compression
        technology; we expect this will become an industry requirement over the coming
        two to five years.home networkingour home networking solutions, which are
        based on the moca standard, target a large and growing market. we are a founding
        member of moca, a global home networking consortium that sets standards for
        the distribution of video and other multimedia entertainment over coaxial
        cable, and we are recognized as the pioneer of moca technology. moca was established
        in 2004 and includes as its members many major service providers, communications
        equipment companies, semiconductor manufacturers and consumer electronics
        companies. moca-based products use existing coaxial cable to create a robust
        internet protocol-based network for easy sharing of hd video and other multimedia
        content throughout the\u00a0home. moca is being deployed as the home networking
        standard for verizon''s fios\u2122 offering and for hd stbs, for directv,
        dish network, comcast, time warner cable, cox communications and other service
        providers. we believe that additional service providers are in the process
        of evaluating, adopting or deploying moca-based technology for digital home
        entertainment networking.the implementation of home networking chipsets based
        on the moca specification requires expertise in multiple technical disciplines
        as well as extensive integration and testing. any home network technology
        using the existing coaxial cable must overcome the inherent constraints of
        such infrastructure. the in-home coaxial cable network was designed to isolate
        individual cable outlets from each other in order to eliminate potential video
        signal interference between television sets that reside at different coaxial
        cable outlets in the home. the successful implementation of moca requires
        integrated circuits that support high wire speed signal transmission and enable
        low-level signal detection, real-time error correction and recovery. the broad
        range of expertise required for such implementation includes physical layer
        and media access controller system engineering, radio frequency integrated
        circuit and high-speed mixed signal design, complex baseband system-on-a-chip
        experience and embedded software expertise. in addition, moca designs must
        undergo a formal certification process in order to ensure interoperability
        and full compliance with the moca specification.we have been working on home
        networking technologies on which the moca specification is based since 2001
        and began shipping production quantities of moca-compliant chipsets in december
        2004. in september 2009, we began shipping our third generation of moca 1.1-compliant
        products and announced the first complete moca 2.0 solution in january 2011.\u00a0during
        2012 we announced our multi-band technology in conjunction with our 4th generation
        moca 1.1 solution and have been sampling our moca 2.0 solution to our key
        customers for products currently in development. our moca-compliant chipsets
        are incorporated in equipment being deployed by verizon, directv, comcast,
        time warner cable, cox and other service providers. our moca-compliant products
        can be used to support on demand video services, online video streaming services,
        personal computer-to-television content sharing, multi-room dvr and online
        gaming. we see a growing need for a highly reliable wired home networking
        solution to support these new multimedia applications. we believe that our
        new moca 2.0 chipset will answer the growing demand for powerful connectivity
        within the home. 8broadband accessour broadband access solutions are designed
        to meet broadband access requirements in areas characterized by fiber optic
        networks that terminate within a few hundred meters of a customer''s premises.
        in particular, our solutions allow cable service operators with fiber optic
        deployments to offer broadband triple-play services that are competitive with
        very high-speed digital subscriber line services offered by telecommunications
        carriers. we believe that this is a large potential target market for our
        broadband access products and we have several deployments underway with service
        providers in china. for example, our broadband access solutions also have
        applications in vertical markets beyond broadband residential access. our
        broadband access solutions have been incorporated into systems currently being
        deployed in hospitality networks, providing video and broadband services over
        coax to multiple hotel residents.our broadband access solutions use coaxial
        cable infrastructure to deliver the \u201clast few hundred meters\u201d of
        connectivity for high-speed broadband access to single-family homes and multiple
        dwelling units. they incorporate the same physical layer used in our home
        networking products and a different network-optimized media access controller
        technology. our broadband access solutions offer high performance with net
        throughput in excess of 100 megabits per second. the point-to-multi-point
        architecture of our solutions currently supports up to 63 subscribers on a
        single radio frequency channel. our solutions are capable of supporting multiple
        channels simultaneously over a single coaxial cable. as a result, this increases
        the number of subscribers that can be supported and the net throughput that
        is available by a multiple of the number of channels that are activated, in
        a single distribution cable. our high-speed broadband access solutions enable
        service providers to offer bundled triple-play services over their existing
        services and cable infrastructure.dbs outdoor unitour dbs outdoor unit solutions
        target the large and growing digital broadcast satellite market. in a traditional
        satellite installation, the ability to select multiple channels simultaneously
        frequently requires multiple cables from the satellite dish to the set-top
        box. for example, in order to simultaneously view and record separate programs
        from the full channel lineup with dvrs in three rooms in a house, a user typically
        needs six separate cables from outside the home. our dbs outdoor unit products
        can significantly reduce the deployment costs for digital broadcast satellite
        providers by allowing them to send multiple video streams from individual
        or multiple satellites into the home over a single cable. this simplified
        cabling architecture enables digital broadcast satellite providers to deploy
        set-top boxes, with multiple tuner capabilities, in multiple rooms and roll
        out new services without expensive installation and retrofitting while at
        the same time improving aesthetics of the home by not damaging walls while
        installing multiple cables. we believe that our solutions can improve the
        competitiveness of digital broadcast satellite services by reducing subscriber
        acquisition costs, decreasing deployment costs for additional services and
        enabling a more attractive product offering.our dbs outdoor unit products
        include band translation switch and channel stacking switch integrated circuits,
        which are highly complex single-chip radio frequency integrated circuits that
        integrate multiple independent signal receivers and multiple discrete analog
        functions onto a single silicon die. moreover, as many as four channel stacking
        switch integrated circuits can be linked to provide up to 12 digital broadcast
        satellite signals on a single cable. our band translation switch products
        were specifically designed to operate with dish network''s service offerings.
        we sell our channel stacking switch products to customers who incorporate
        them into products deployed by other dbs service providers. we are the pioneers
        in developing band translation switch and channel stacking switch radio frequency
        integrated circuits and we have helped to define the standard for satellite
        signal distribution over a single cable in conjunction with members of the
        european committee for electrotechnical standardization, or cenelec. we believe
        that single cable standardization will lead to more rapid adoption and further
        expand the market for our products. our band translation switch products are
        currently used in outdoor equipment deployed by dish network and one other
        north american operator and our channel stacking switch products are currently
        used in outdoor equipment deployed by directv, directv panamericana, clarotv
        (formerly via embratel), sky italia, bskyb and other service providers.our
        strategyour goal is to be the leading provider of systems solutions for the
        connected home entertainment market by enabling the delivery, connection and
        consumption of multiple streams of hd video and other multimedia content into
        and throughout the home. the key elements of our strategy are to:  9\u2022extend
        our technology leadership.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we believe that our success
        has been, and will continue to be, largely attributable to our interdisciplinary
        skill set that we leverage to create innovative systems-level solutions. as
        the incumbent supplier of key video delivery, distribution and processing
        technologies in service provider-based deployments, we gain critical insight
        into next generation product and system requirements. we have and will continue
        to use these insights to enhance our products. for example, as a result of
        our leadership in developing moca 1.0 and 1.1 compliant solutions, we were
        a leading contributor to the development of the next generation moca 2.0 specification.
        we intend to extend our technology leadership by focusing on our research
        and development efforts and through targeted technology acquisitions.\u2022expand
        relationships with industry leaders and customers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we
        work very closely with leading service providers, odms and oems around the
        world to increase the adoption of connected home entertainment solutions that
        utilize our technology. we have been selected in deployments by leading service
        providers including verizon, directv, comcast, cox communications and time
        warner cable, among others, and leading odms and oems such as motorola mobility
        inc. (formerly motorola, inc.), or motorola, wistron neweb corporation, or
        wistron, and actiontec electronics, inc., or actiontec, technicolor (formerly
        thomson), humax co., ltd., or humax, and cisco systems inc., or cisco. we
        believe that expanding our relationships with these companies and further
        aligning our product and technology roadmap with their strategies will contribute
        to our future growth. we intend to expand our existing customer relationships
        by securing additional design wins with our customers and by positioning our
        connected home entertainment technology as the key differentiator in next
        generation customer premises equipment. we also intend to expand our relationships
        with consumer electronics oems to increase adoption of our solutions and further
        develop a retail market for connected home entertainment solutions.\u2022continue
        to broaden our solutions and pursue complementary acquisitions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we
        seek to provide our customers with full platform solutions. historically,
        we have used acquisitions to broaden our technology and solutions capabilities
        and expand our customer base. for example, our company was originally focused
        on the development of moca home networking solutions. since that time we have
        made multiple acquisitions, including acquiring from trident the assets of
        its stb business in 2012 and acquiring certain assets from mobius in 2013
        that allow us to provide cable and satellite operators with solutions that
        encompass system designs that are low power, high-speed, and which capture
        the full bandwidth of the signal payload - to drive more entertainment streams
        and ip services to more connected devices in the home. over time, we intend
        to address the large and growing connected home entertainment market by adding
        additional features and capabilities to our products and provide full platform
        solutions and opportunistically pursue acquisitions that contribute complementary
        technology or provide access to new customers.\u2022expand our presence in
        international markets.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0historically, we have been principally
        focused on odms and oems that supply equipment for service provider-based
        deployments in the united states. we intend to continue to expand our sales
        and technical support organization to broaden our service provider reach in
        international markets, primarily in asia, europe and south america. for example,
        we are actively marketing our stb soc products in europe and asia, our moca
        home networking solutions in europe and south america, our broadband access
        solutions in china, and our dbs outdoor unit solutions in europe, south america,
        and africa.\u2022drive industry standards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we use our
        technology leadership to define specifications and drive industry standards,
        such as moca, which we believe will lead to widespread adoption of our solutions.
        in europe, we have actively worked with members of cenelec to develop a standard
        for satellite signal distribution over a single cable. we intend to continue
        to participate in other standards-settings bodies that we believe will influence
        our target markets, including cablelabs, the itu, the institute of electrical
        and electronics engineers, the rvu alliance and digital living network alliance.

        (s/w and design collateral) are purchased by major consumer electronic odms
        and oems around the world. our ics provide the core functionality of connected
        home entertainment equipment and solutions offered by these odms and oems.
        the odms and oems, in turn, supply numerous service providers globally to
        bring entertainment content to consumers around the world. our ic products
        have been selected by leading equipment manufacturers such as actiontec, cisco,
        motorola, samsung electronics co., ltd., technicolor (formerly named thomson),
        globalsat, humax co., ltd., wistron and zinwell corporation for deployments
        by leading service providers such as directv, dish network, comcast, time
        warner cable, cox and verizon. 12we currently rely, and expect to continue
        to rely, on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our
        net revenues. for example, for the year ended december\u00a031, 2013, wistron
        neweb corporation, or wistron, and foxconn electronics inc., or foxconn, a
        sub-contractor for cisco and motorola, accounted for 18% and 16% of our net
        revenues, respectively. for the year ended december\u00a031, 2012, wistron
        and motorola accounted for 21% and 13% of our net revenues, respectively.
        for the year ended december\u00a031, 2011, wistron and motorola accounted
        for 25% and 17% of our net revenues, respectively. in addition, we depend
        on a limited number of service providers that purchase products from customers
        that incorporate our products. for the year ended december\u00a031, 2013,
        87% of our net revenues were derived from asia, 12% were derived from north
        america and 1% were derived from europe. for the year ended december\u00a031,
        2012, 88% of our net revenues were derived from asia, 10% were derived from
        north america and 2% were derived from europe. for the year ended december\u00a031,
        2011, 89% of our net revenues were derived from asia, 11% were derived from
        north america and less than 1% were derived from europe. many of our odm and
        oem customers in asia incorporate our chipsets into products that they sell
        to u.s.-based service providers.additional information concerning the allocation
        of our net revenues and long-lived assets by geographic region can be found
        in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
        this report.research and developmentwe believe our future success depends,
        in part, on our ability to introduce enhancements to our existing products
        and to develop new products for existing and emerging markets. we work closely
        with service providers and their odm and oem partners to understand their
        requirements and align our research and development efforts to meet their
        system requirements. we are also actively engaged in advancing industry initiatives,
        such as the moca home networking standard and video codec development for
        ultra-high definition television and the h.265 standard through our research
        and development efforts. we have assembled a team of highly skilled design
        engineers with core competencies in complex audio, video and communications
        chipsets, radio frequency integrated circuits and application level and embedded  software
        expertise. our engineers are responsible for new product development efforts
        while continuing to enhance existing products and provide critical technical
        support to our customers.as of december\u00a031, 2013, we had 404 full-time
        employees engaged in research and development. for the years ended december\u00a031,
        2013, 2012 and 2011, the total amount that we spent on research and development
        activities was $114.5 million, $98.4 million and $60.1 million, respectively.manufacturingwe
        use third-party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture,
        assemble and test our products. this outsourced manufacturing approach allows
        us to focus our resources on the design, sales and marketing of our products
        and avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing
        facility. our engineers work closely with foundries and other contractors
        to increase yields, lower manufacturing costs and improve quality.we currently
        outsource the manufacturing of our stb soc, home networking and broadband
        access products, principally to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company,
        or tsmc, and globalfoundries, and the manufacturing of our dbs outdoor unit
        products to towerjazz, the name under which tower semiconductor ltd. and its
        fully owned u.s. subsidiary jazz semiconductor operate. our products are shipped
        from such third-party foundries to third-party assembly and testing facilities.
        our products are assembled and tested by amkor technologies, inc., or amkor,
        advanced semiconductor engineering group, or ase group, united test and assembly
        center, or utac, nxp semiconductors, or nxp, and giga solution tech. co.,
        ltd., or giga solution. we have implemented a robust quality management system
        designed to assure high levels of product quality for our customers. we have
        completed and have been awarded iso 9001:2000 certification. in addition,
        the independent foundries, assembly and test subcontractors identified above
        have been awarded iso 9001:2000 certifications, among others. 13sales and
        marketingwe sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, including
        our direct sales force and our network of domestic and international sales
        representatives and distributors. we have strategically located our direct
        sales personnel in the united states, europe, china, taiwan, japan and korea,
        where each salesperson generally targets a specific end-user market. our sales
        directors focus their efforts on leading odms and oems. we also have field
        application engineers who provide technical support and assistance to existing
        and potential customers in designing, testing, qualifying and certifying systems
        that incorporate our products.our sales and marketing strategy is to achieve
        design wins with leading odms and oems and mass deployment of our solutions
        with service providers worldwide. this requires us to work extensively and
        collaboratively with our odm and oem customers as well as the service providers
        who purchase products from them. as a result, we believe that our established
        relationships allow us faster time to market and will lead to greater proliferation
        of our products.our marketing group focuses on our product strategy and management,
        product development roadmaps, product positioning, new product launch and
        transition, demand assessment and competitive analysis. the group also ensures
        that product development activities, product launch, channel marketing program
        activities, and ongoing demand and supply planning occur in a well-managed
        and timely manner in coordination with our development, operations and sales
        groups as well as our service provider representatives, odms and oems. our
        marketing group also has programs in place to work closely with service providers
        in the role of a \u201ctrusted advisor\u201d for stb deployments and initiatives
        designed to heighten industry awareness of our company, products and technologies,
        including participating in technical conferences, support of industry initiatives
        such as moca and rvu at the board of directors level, publication of technical
        white papers and exhibition at trade shows.backlogour sales are made primarily
        pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. quantities
        of our products to be delivered and delivery schedules are frequently revised
        to reflect changes in our customers'' needs. additionally, customer orders
        generally can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the
        customer. for these reasons, our backlog of product inventory as of any particular
        date is not representative of actual sales for any succeeding period and,
        therefore, we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator
        of future net revenue levels.competitionthe markets for our products are extremely
        competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving
        industry standards and new demands for features and performance of multimedia
        content delivery solutions. we believe the principal competitive factors in
        our markets include the following:\u2022the adoption of our products and technologies
        by service providers, odms and oems;\u2022the performance and cost effectiveness
        of our products relative to our competitors'' products; \u2022our ability
        to deliver high quality and reliable products in large volumes and on a timely
        basis; \u2022our ability to build close relationships with service providers,
        odms and oems; \u2022our success in developing and utilizing new technologies
        to offer products and features not previously available in the marketplace
        that are technologically superior to those offered by our competitors; \u2022our
        ability to identify new and emerging markets and market trends;\u2022our ability
        to recruit design and application engineers and other technical personnel;
        and \u2022our ability to protect our intellectual property and obtain licenses
        to the intellectual property of others on commercially reasonable terms. 14we
        believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these criteria.
        however, conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly
        as a result of technological advancements or the adoption of new standards
        for the delivery of hd video and other multimedia content. in addition, many
        of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories,
        significantly greater resources, stronger name recognition and a larger base
        of customers than we do. this may allow our competitors to respond more quickly
        than we are able to respond to new or emerging technologies or changes in
        customer requirements or it may allow them to deliver products that are priced
        lower than our products or which include features and functions that are not
        included in our products.in the market for stb socs we compete primarily against
        broadcom corporation, or broadcom, and st microelectronics n.v., or stmicro.
        broadcom offers a full range of products with new technology, comprehensive
        customer support and aggressive pricing on high capability devices. stmicro
        still has a large presence and is typically found competing against us in
        lower cost programs. however, newer asian entrants such as hisilicon and mediatek
        are aggressively pricing lower cost products along with stmicro. mediatek
        and stmicro are also attempting to establish themselves in higher value markets
        such as north america. given significant hurdles to market entry in north
        america, broadcom and, to a lesser extent, stmicro, continue to be our primary
        competitors in these markets.in the market for home networking solutions,
        we compete against other semiconductor manufacturers that offer functionality
        based on the moca standard. for example, for several years we have been competing
        with moca solutions offered by broadcom, and we expect to continue to compete
        with broadcom and other semiconductor manufacturers in the manufacture and
        sale of moca-compliant chipsets in the future. we also compete against companies
        that offer products based on non-moca home networking solutions, such as ethernet,
        homepna, home plug av and wi-fi, and potentially g.hn when products incorporating
        the standard for that technology are introduced to the market.in the dbs market,
        our band translation switch and channel stacking switch products face competition
        from discrete solution providers including broadcom, maxlinear and other semiconductor
        manufacturers who offer products with similar functionality. in the broadband
        access market, our broadband access products compete with other, more well-established
        high-speed wide area networking technologies such as docsis, versions of digital
        subscriber line, or xdsl, ethernet, xpon, and 3rd generation partnership project
        long term evolution and worldwide interoperability for microwave access, or
        wimax. while we believe that our products compete favorably against alternative
        technologies in these markets, the ultimate competitiveness of our products
        is highly dependent on, and sensitive to, the particular facts and circumstances
        of each service provider and its end user customers, such as the type of media
        content being distributed, the environment in which the distribution is taking
        place, the available network bandwidth and distribution mediums and the number
        of devices connected to a network.intellectual propertyour success and future
        revenue growth depend, in part, on our ability to develop and protect our
        intellectual property. we rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and
        trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods,
        to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. however, these measures
        may not provide meaningful protection for our intellectual property. we review
        our technological developments to identify features that provide us with a
        technological or commercial advantage and we file patent applications when
        we deem it to be appropriate to protect these features in the united states
        and internationally in select countries. in addition to developing technology
        internally, some of which is patentable, we continually evaluate the acquisition
        and licensing of intellectual property from third-parties that complements
        our business. as of december\u00a031, 2013, we had over 2000 issued and pending
        patents in the united states and foreign countries. the term of an issued
        patent in the united states is at least 20 years from its filing date, unless
        subject to a terminal disclaimer. the u.s. patent and trademark office provides
        term extensions for those applications that have been pending for more than
        three years and for which the duration of the pendency is not the fault of
        the applicant. accordingly, many of our patents may receive a longer term
        due to the benefit of such patent term extensions. taking such patent terms
        and any terminal disclaimers into account, the remaining terms of our issued
        u.s. patents range from 14 to 17 years and the remaining terms for counter-part
        patents in most foreign jurisdictions are similar, provided we pay the applicable
        maintenance fees throughout the terms of our issued u.s. and granted foreign
        patents.we are the owner of several registered trademarks in the united states
        and in certain foreign countries, including \u201centropic,\u201d \u201centropic
        communications,\u201d \u201cc.link,\u201d \u201ccss\u201d and \u201crf magic.\u201d
        15in connection with our membership in moca, we are required to license any
        of our patent claims that are essential to implement the moca specification
        to other moca members under reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. because
        our core home networking technology is a primary component of the moca specification,
        we are required to license portions of this technology to other moca members,
        including other semiconductor manufacturers that may compete with us in the
        sale of moca-compliant chipsets. however, only essential patent claims necessary
        to implement the moca specification are subject to this requirement. we are
        not required to license patent claims that are not essential to implement
        the moca specification, nor are we required to license patent claims that
        are unrelated to the moca specification. to date we have not entered into
        a license of our moca-related patent claims, so the terms of any required
        license have not been established.in addition to the licensing requirements
        of standards bodies to which we belong, such as moca, in connection with our
        sales or product development activities, we are also sometimes required by
        our customers or service providers to license to unrelated third parties,
        on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, patents and patent applications
        associated with technologies purchased or used by, or developed with or for,
        such customers or service providers. we expect that in the future we may be
        required to agree to such licensing arrangements in order to secure sales,
        receive development funds or settle disputes.in addition to our patent rights,
        we hold significant intellectual property in the form of proprietary trade
        secrets which we rely on to compete. designing integrated circuits for set-top
        boxes (including those that comply with the moca specification) or that implement
        our dbs outdoor unit solutions is technically difficult and requires the application
        of a wide range of complex engineering disciplines. during the course of creating
        the technology on which these products are based, we developed significant
        proprietary know-how and techniques for overcoming the engineering challenges
        involved in designing such products. we retain such know-how and techniques
        as proprietary trade secrets that we are not required to license to others
        as a result of our membership in moca. similarly, we have developed significant
        proprietary know-how and techniques for implementing our dbs outdoor unit
        solutions in satellite installations. consequently, even though we are required
        to license patent claims that are essential to implement the moca standard
        to other moca members and have agreed to license patents and patent applications
        related to other technologies, such as our dbs outdoor unit solutions and
        stb soc solutions, to third parties on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms,
        we believe that such licensees would need to overcome significant engineering
        challenges and develop or obtain comparable proprietary know-how and techniques
        in order to design products that compete successfully against ours.we generally
        enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic
        partners, and typically control access to and distribution of our proprietary
        information. our employees are generally required to assign their intellectual
        property rights to us and to treat all technology as our confidential information.government
        regulationas a company that provides systems solutions composed of silicon
        integrated circuits with embedded software, we are subject to certain government
        regulations, including u.s. export controls and foreign countries'' import
        regulations, as well as customs duties and export quotas, regulations relating
        to the materials that comprise our products and regulations placing constraints
        on our customers and service providers'' services (such as the federal communications
        commission''s regulations relating to radio frequency signals emitted in the
        united states and laws and regulations regarding local cable franchising).employeesas
        of december\u00a031, 2013, we employed a total of 639 people on a full-time
        basis, including 404 in research and development, 168 in sales, marketing
        and general and administrative, and 67 in operations. we also engage temporary
        employees and consultants. our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel
        is essential to our continued success. none of our employees are subject to
        a collective bargaining agreement. we have never experienced a work stoppage
        and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 16executive officers

        factorsinvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. before
        deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully
        consider the following information, the other information in this annual report
        on form 10-k, or annual report, and in our other filings with the securities
        and exchange commission, or sec. if any of these risks were to occur, our
        business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be
        materially and adversely affected. in that event, the trading price of our
        common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
        these risks and uncertainties may be interrelated or co-related, and as a
        result, the occurrence of one risk might directly affect other risks described
        below, make them more likely to occur or magnify their impact. moreover, the
        risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. additional
        risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem
        immaterial may also affect our business.risks related to our businesswe have
        had net operating losses for most of the time we have been in existence, had
        an accumulated deficit of $212.3 million as of december\u00a031, 2013 and
        we are unable to predict if or when we will return to profitability.we were
        incorporated in 2001, did not commence shipping production quantities of our
        connectivity solutions until december 2004 and while we were profitable on
        an annual basis from 2010 through 2012, we incurred a net loss in 2013. consequently,
        any predictions about future performance of our going forward operations may
        not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer history of successfully
        commercializing our connectivity solutions and the more recently acquired
        stb soc solutions, and of profitable operations. you should not rely on our
        operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication
        of our future operating performance.for the year ended december\u00a031, 2013
        we generated a net loss of $66.2 million, while during the years ended 2012
        and 2011 we generated net income of $4.5 million and $26.6 million, respectively.
        while we have some recent history of profitability, we have incurred substantial
        net losses since our inception. as of december\u00a031, 2013, we had an accumulated
        deficit of $212.3 million and we expect to incur additional operating losses
        as we develop our stb soc and connectivity solutions and expand our business.our
        ability to return to profitability depends on the extent to which we can increase
        revenue and control our costs in order to, among other things, counter any
        unforeseen difficulties, complications, product delays or other unknown factors
        that may require additional expenditures, or unforeseen difficulties or costs
        associated with the integration of acquired assets or businesses. because
        of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our growth prospects,
        product development, sales and marketing and other efforts, we are unable
        to predict the extent of our future losses. if we are unable to achieve adequate
        growth, we may not return to profitability.we face intense competition and
        expect competition to increase in the future, with many of our competitors
        being larger, more established and better capitalized than we are.the markets
        for our stb soc and connectivity solutions are extremely competitive and have
        been characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards,
        rapid changes in customer requirements, short product life cycles and frequent
        introduction of next generation and new solutions, as well as competing technologies.
        this competition could make it more difficult for us to sell our solutions
        and result in increased pricing pressure, reduced gross profit as a percentage
        of revenues or gross margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure
        to increase or the loss of market share or expected market share. semiconductor
        solutions in particular have a history of declining prices driven by customer
        insistence on lower prices as the cost of production is reduced and as demand
        falls when competitive products or newer, more advanced, products are introduced.
        if market prices decrease faster than product costs, our gross margins and
        operating margins would be adversely affected. 19moreover, we expect increased
        competition from other established and emerging companies both domestically
        and internationally. in particular, we currently face, or in the future expect
        to face, competition from companies such as broadcom corporation, stmicroelectronics
        n.v., or stmicro, sigma designs, inc., mstar semiconductor, inc., intel corporation,
        marvell technology group ltd., maxlinear, inc., or maxlinear, qualcomm incorporated,
        lantiq deutschland gmbh and vixs systems, inc., in the sale of moca compliant
        chipsets and technology, and from companies such as broadcom, nxp semiconductors
        n.v., maxlinear and stmicro, in the sale of dbs odu products and from companies
        such as broadcom, stmicro, mediatek inc., mstar semiconductor, inc., sigma
        designs, inc., marvell, amlogic, abilis, intel, qualcomm, hisilicon technologies
        and vixs in the sale of stb socs, and other stb solutions. consolidation by
        industry participants could result in competitors with further increased market
        share, larger customer bases, greater diversified product offerings and greater
        technological and marketing expertise, which would allow them to compete more
        effectively against us. in addition, current and potential competitors may
        establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.
        if so, competitors or alliances that include our competitors may emerge and
        could acquire significant market share. further, our current and potential
        competitors may also enter into licensing arrangements with third parties
        with respect to moca chipsets or other technology on licensing terms that
        are more favorable than the licensing terms that we would be able to offer
        through the direct licensing of our moca chipsets and other technology to
        such third parties. we expect these trends to continue as companies attempt
        to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry.
        in addition, our competitors could develop solutions or technologies that
        cause our solutions and technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete,
        or cause us to substantially reduce our prices.in addition to direct competitors,
        we also face competition from a number of established companies that offer
        products based on competing technologies. for example, our connectivity products
        compete with home networking and access products based on other technologies,
        such as docsis, versions of dsl, ethernet, homepna, homeplug av, broadband
        over power line, high performance network over coax, wi-fi and lte solutions.
        although some of these competing technologies were not originally designed
        to operate over coaxial cables, our competitors have modified certain technologies,
        including homepna, homeplug av, broadband over power line and wi-fi, to work
        on the same in-home coaxial cables that our connectivity solutions use. we
        also expect to face competition from companies that offer products based on
        g.hn technology in the future. many of our competitors and potential competitors
        are substantially larger and have longer operating histories, larger customer
        bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and
        other resources than we do. given their capital resources, many of these larger
        organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction
        in customer purchases or market downturns. many of our competitors also have
        broader product lines and market focus, allowing them to bundle their products
        and services and effectively use other products to subsidize lower prices
        for those products that compete with ours or to provide integrated product
        solutions that offer cost advantages to their customers. in addition, many
        of our competitors have been in operation much longer than we have and therefore
        have better name recognition and more long-standing and established relationships
        with service providers, odms and oems.our ability to compete depends on a
        number of factors, including:\u2022the adoption of our solutions and technologies
        by service providers, odms and oems;\u2022the performance and cost effectiveness
        of our solutions relative to our competitors\u2019 products;\u2022our ability
        to deliver high quality and reliable solutions in large volumes and on a timely
        basis;\u2022our ability to build and maintain close relationships with service
        providers, odms, oems, retailers and consumer electronics manufacturers;\u2022our
        success in developing and utilizing new technologies to offer solutions and
        features previously not available in the marketplace that are technologically
        superior to those offered by our competitors;\u2022our ability to identify
        new and emerging markets and market trends;\u2022our ability to reduce our
        product costs and receive favorable pricing from our suppliers;\u2022our ability
        to recruit design and application engineers and other technical personnel;\u2022our
        ability to protect our intellectual property and obtain licenses to the intellectual
        property of others on commercially reasonable terms; \u2022our ability to
        transition our customers from older to newer generations of our solutions;\u2022our
        ability to expand our market penetration and revenue growth outside of the
        united states; and\u2022our ability to create a retail market for our connectivity
        solutions in consumer electronics devices, such as televisions. 20our inability
        to address any of these factors effectively, alone or in combination with
        others, could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial
        condition.we depend on a limited number of customers, and ultimately service
        providers, for a substantial portion of our revenues, and the loss of, or
        a significant shortfall in, orders from any of these parties could significantly
        impair our financial condition and results of operations.we derive a substantial
        portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. for example, during
        the year ended december\u00a031, 2013, wistron and foxconn accounted for approximately
        18% and 16% of our net revenues, respectively; for the year ended december\u00a031,
        2012, wistron and motorola accounted for 21% and 13% of our net revenues,
        respectively; and for the year ended december\u00a031, 2011, wistron and motorola
        accounted for 25% and 17% of our net revenues, respectively. our inability
        to generate anticipated revenues from our key existing or targeted customers,
        or a significant shortfall in sales to certain of these customers would significantly
        reduce our revenues and adversely affect our operating results. our operating
        results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on our ability to
        sell our solutions to our existing and prospective large customers.further,
        we depend on a limited number of service providers that purchase products
        from our customers which incorporate our solutions. our ability to build and
        maintain close relationships with service providers is a key factor affecting
        the deployment and purchase of our solutions. if these service providers,
        or other service providers that elect to use our solutions, delay, reduce
        or eliminate purchases of our customers\u2019 products which incorporate our
        solutions, this would significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect
        our operating results. in addition, any delayed launch or any sudden or unexpected
        slowdown in deployments by service providers that incorporate our solutions
        may lead to an inventory buildup by service providers or by our customers
        who may, in turn, postpone taking delivery of our solutions or wait to clear
        their existing inventory before ordering more solutions from us, which, in
        turn, may adversely affect our results. our operating results for the foreseeable
        future will continue to depend on a limited number of service providers\u2019
        demand for products which incorporate our solutions.we may have conflicts
        with our customers, including customers we have acquired as part of our acquisition
        of the stb business from trident with whom we have a limited history, or the
        service providers that purchase products from our customers that incorporate
        our solutions. any such conflict could result in events that have a negative
        impact on our business, including:\u2022reduced purchases of our solutions
        or our customers\u2019 products that incorporate them;\u2022uncertainty regarding
        ownership of intellectual property rights;\u2022litigation or the threat of
        litigation; or\u2022settlements or other business arrangements imposing obligations
        on us or restrictions on our business, including obligations to license intellectual
        property rights or make cash payments.if we fail to develop and introduce
        new or enhanced solutions on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain
        customers could be impaired, and our competitive position may be harmed.the
        industries in which we compete are volatile and highly competitive. in order
        to compete effectively, we must continually introduce new products or enhance
        existing products and accurately anticipate customer requirements for new
        and upgraded products. the introduction of new products by our competitors,
        the market acceptance of solutions based on new or alternative technologies,
        or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future
        solutions obsolete. our failure to anticipate or timely develop new or enhanced
        solutions or technologies in response to technological shifts or changes in
        customer requirements could result in decreased revenues and an increase in
        design wins by our competitors.new product development or the enhancement
        of existing products is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. we
        may experience difficulties with solution design, manufacturing or certification
        that could delay or prevent the introduction of new or enhanced solutions.
        alternatively, even if technical engineering hurdles can be overcome, we must
        successfully anticipate customer requirements regarding features and performance,
        the new or enhanced products must be competitively priced, and they must become
        available during the window of time when customers are ready to purchase our
        solutions. 21even after new or enhanced products are developed, we must be
        able to successfully bring them to market. the success of new product introductions
        depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful
        product development, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated
        with new product production ramp-up issues, the effective management of purchase
        commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand,
        the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated
        demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in
        the early stages of introduction. accordingly, we cannot determine in advance
        the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions, and any
        failure to manage new product introduction risks could adversely affect our
        business.our results could be adversely affected if our customers or the service
        providers who purchase their products are unable to successfully compete in
        their respective markets.our customers and the service providers that purchase
        products from our customers face significant competition from their competitors.
        we rely on these customers\u2019 and service providers\u2019 ability to develop
        products and/or services that meet the needs of their customers in terms of
        functionality, performance, availability and price. if these customers and
        service providers do not successfully compete, they may lose market share,
        which would negatively impact the demand for our solutions. for example, for
        our connectivity solutions there is intense competition among service providers
        to deliver video and other multimedia content into and throughout the home.
        for the sale of our connectivity solutions, we are currently dependent on
        the ability of a limited number of service providers to compete in the market
        for the delivery of high-definition television-quality video, or hd video,
        and other multimedia content. therefore, factors influencing the ability of
        these service providers to compete in this market, such as competition from
        alternative content providers or laws and regulations regarding local cable
        franchising or satellite broadcasting rights, could have an adverse effect
        on our ability to sell connectivity solutions. in addition, our digital broadcast
        satellite outdoor unit solutions are primarily supplied to digital broadcast
        satellite service providers by our odm and oem customers. digital broadcast
        satellite service providers are facing significant competition from telecommunications
        carriers and cable service operators as they compete for customers in terms
        of video, voice and data services. moreover, odms and oems who market cable
        and satellite stbs are competing with a variety of internet protocol-based
        video delivery solutions, including versions of dsl technology and certain
        fiber optic-based solutions. many of these technologies compete effectively
        with cable and satellite stbs. if our customers and the service providers
        who purchase products from our customers that incorporate our solutions do
        not successfully compete, they may lose market share, which would reduce demand
        for our solutions.if the market for hd video and other multimedia content
        delivery solutions does not continue to develop as we anticipate, our revenues
        may decline or fail to grow, which would adversely affect our operating results.we
        derive, and expect to continue to derive for the foreseeable future, a significant
        portion of our revenues from sales of our connectivity solutions based on
        the moca standard. the market for multimedia content delivery solutions based
        on the moca standard is relatively new, still evolving and difficult to predict.
        currently, the growth of the moca-based multimedia content delivery market
        is largely driven by the adoption and deployment of existing and future generations
        of the technology by service providers, odms and oems and, to a lesser extent,
        by consumer adoption of such technology which is dependent on upgrades from
        standard definition television services to high-definition television services,
        or hd services, and on the availability of over-the-top, or ott, services
        that directly deliver internet video content into the home. it is difficult
        to predict whether the moca standard will continue to achieve and sustain
        high levels of demand and market acceptance by service providers or consumers,
        the rate at which consumers will upgrade to hd services, whether the availability
        of ott services will continue to grow or whether consumers beyond the early
        technology adopters will embrace ott services in increasing numbers, if at
        all. even if moca solutions continue to proliferate, it is difficult to anticipate
        the specifications and features that service providers will require for moca-based
        products purchased for their deployments. failure to accurately make such
        predictions may have a material adverse effect on revenue and expense projections.
        even if products incorporating our moca solutions are ultimately selected
        by service providers, the timing and speed of deployments of such products
        by service providers are subject to variables outside of our control which
        make it difficult to accurately predict revenues for any given period. 22with
        regard to connectivity solutions, some service providers, odms and oems have
        adopted, and others may adopt, multimedia content delivery solutions that
        rely on technologies other than the moca standard or may choose to wait for
        the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement
        or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, moca-based solutions.
        the alternative technology solutions which compete with moca-based solutions
        include ethernet, homepna, homeplug av and wi-fi. it is critical to our success
        that additional service providers, including telecommunications carriers,
        digital broadcast satellite service providers and cable operators, adopt the
        moca standard for home networking and deploy moca solutions to their customers.
        if the market for moca-based solutions does not continue to develop or develops
        more slowly than we expect, or if we make errors in predicting adoption and
        deployment rates for these solutions, our revenues may be significantly adversely
        affected. our operating results may also be adversely affected by any delays
        in consumer upgrade to hd services, delays in consumer adoption of ott services,
        or if the market for ott services develops more slowly than we expect.many
        of these same market dynamics apply to advanced stb socs which we acquired
        when we purchased the stb business of trident. for example, some of our stb
        solutions use google''s android operating system, which allows third party
        applications and other advanced features to be deployed by service providers.
        the market for such advanced stb features is relatively new, still evolving
        and difficult to predict. the future success of our stb solutions may depend
        on the adoption and deployment of advanced stb features by service providers
        and the availability of ott services that deliver internet video content into
        the home. as with our connectivity solutions, it is difficult to predict the
        levels of demand and market acceptance of advanced stb solutions, and therefore,
        if may be difficult to predict future revenues and our investment return from
        stb solutions that offer advanced features.even if service providers, odms
        and oems adopt multimedia content delivery solutions based on the moca standard,
        we may not compete successfully in the market for moca-compliant chipsets.as
        a member of moca, we are required to license any of our patent claims that
        are essential to implement the moca specifications to other moca members on
        reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. as a result, we are required to license
        some of our important intellectual property to other moca members, including
        other semiconductor manufacturers that may compete with us in the sale of
        moca-compliant chipsets. furthermore, there may be disagreements among moca
        members as to specifically which of our patent claims we are required to license
        to them. if we are unable to differentiate our moca-compliant chipsets from
        other moca-compliant chipsets by offering superior pricing and features outside
        moca specifications, we may not be able to compete effectively in the market
        for such chipsets. moreover, although we are currently and actively involved
        in the ongoing development of the moca standard, we cannot guarantee that
        future moca specifications will incorporate technologies or product features
        we are developing or that our solutions will be compatible with future moca
        specifications. as additional members, including our competitors, continue
        to join moca, they and existing members may exert greater influence on moca
        and the development of the moca standard in a manner that is adverse to our
        interests. if our connectivity solutions fail to comply with future moca specifications,
        the demand for these solutions could be severely reduced. 23the semiconductor
        and communications industries are highly cyclical and subject to rapid change
        and evolving industry standards and, from time to time, have experienced significant
        downturns in customer demand as well as unexpected increases in demand resulting
        in production capacity constraints.  these factors could impact our operating
        results, financial condition and cash flows and may increase the volatility
        of the price of our common stock.the semiconductor and communications industries
        are highly cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards
        and, from time to time, have experienced significant downturns in customer
        demand.  these downturns are characterized by decreases in product demand,
        excess customer inventories and accelerated erosion of prices; factors which
        have caused, and could continue to cause, substantial fluctuations in our
        net revenue and in our operating results. any downturns in the semiconductor
        and communications industries may be severe and prolonged, and any failure
        of these industries to fully recover from downturns could harm our business.
        for example, because a significant portion of our expense is fixed in the
        near term or is incurred in advance of anticipated sales, during these downturns
        we may not be able to decrease our expenses rapidly enough to offset unanticipated
        shortfalls in revenues during industry downturns, which would adversely affect
        our operating results. even as the industry recovers from a downturn, some
        oems and odms may continue to slow down their research and development activities,
        cancel or delay new product development, reduce their inventories and/or take
        a cautious approach to acquiring products, which may negatively impact our
        business.the semiconductor and communications industries also periodically
        experience increased demand and production capacity constraints, which may
        affect the ability of companies such as ours to ship products to customers.
        any factor adversely affecting either the semiconductor or communications
        industries in general, or the particular segments of any of these industries
        that our solutions target, may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue
        and could negatively impact our operating results, cash flow and financial
        condition. the semiconductor and communications industries may experience
        supply shortages due to sudden increases in demand beyond foundry capacity.
        in addition to capacity issues, during periods of increased demand these industries
        may also experience difficulty obtaining sufficient manufacturing, assembly
        and test resources from manufacturers. if, as a result of these industry issues
        or other factors that cause capacity constraints at our suppliers, we are
        unable to meet our customers'' increased demand for our solutions, we would
        miss opportunities for additional revenue and could experience a negative
        impact on our relationships with affected customers. our operating results
        have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect them to continue to
        fluctuate in the future, which could lead to volatility in the price of our
        common stock.our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely
        to continue to fluctuate, on an annual and a quarterly basis, as a result
        of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. for example,
        while we were profitable in 2010 through 2012, we incurred a net loss in 2013.
        these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to fluctuate
        as well. the primary factors that are likely to affect our quarterly and annual
        operating results include:\u2022changes in demand for our solutions or products
        offered by service providers and our customers;\u2022the timing and amount
        of orders, especially from significant service providers and customers;\u2022the
        seasonal nature of the sales of products that incorporate our solutions by
        certain service providers which may affect the timing of orders for our solutions;\u2022the
        level and timing of capital spending of service providers, both in the united
        states and in international markets;\u2022competitive market conditions, including
        pricing actions by us or our competitors;\u2022adverse perception of our company,
        our solutions and our products or their features by service providers or our
        customers, or in the market generally;\u2022any delay in the development,
        certification or adoption associated with new moca standards by the alliance,
        oems or service providers; \u2022any cut backs or delayed deployments of products
        that include our solutions by service providers;\u2022our unpredictable and
        lengthy sales cycles;\u2022the mix of solutions and solution configurations
        sold;\u2022our ability to successfully define, design and release new solutions
        on a timely basis that meet customers\u2019 or service providers\u2019 needs;\u2022costs
        related to acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses,
        including costs associated with our 2012 acquisition of the stb business of
        trident and our recent 2013 acquisition of assets from mobius; 24\u2022new
        solution introductions and enhancements, or the market anticipation of new
        solutions and enhancements, by us or our competitors;\u2022the timing of revenue
        recognition on sales arrangements, which may include multiple deliverables
        and the effect of our use of inventory \u201chubbing\u201d arrangements;\u2022unexpected
        changes in our operating expenses;\u2022general economic conditions and political
        conditions in the countries where we operate or our solutions are sold or
        used;\u2022our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality
        levels for our solutions, including adequate allocation of wafer, assembly
        and test capacity for our solutions by our subcontractors;\u2022our customers\u2019
        ability to obtain other components needed to manufacture their products;\u2022the
        cost and availability of components and raw materials used in our solutions,
        including, without limitation, the price of gold and copper;\u2022changes
        in manufacturing costs, including wafer, test and assembly costs, manufacturing
        yields and solution quality and reliability;\u2022productivity of our sales
        and marketing force;\u2022long, engineering-intensive product development
        and testing cycles, including expensive third-party \"tape-out\" costs required
        to bring parts to production, which make it difficult to quickly adjust expenses
        in response to changes in revenue or revenue outlook;\u2022fixed expenses
        and long-term commitments that also limit our ability to reduce operating
        expenses in a particular quarter if revenues for that quarter fall below expectations;\u2022future
        accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policies;\u2022disputes
        between content owners and service providers that result in the delay or elimination
        of the sale of products using our technology;\u2022costs associated with litigation;
        and\u2022domestic and international regulatory changes.unfavorable changes
        in any of the above factors, many of which are beyond our control, could significantly
        harm our business and results of operations. you should not rely on the results
        of prior periods as an indication of our future performance.our sales are
        subject to seasonality, which may cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter
        to quarter.many of our solutions are incorporated into consumer electronic
        devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand.\u00a0
        as a result, we tend to have slower sales in the first quarter of each year
        and, to a lesser extent, in the second quarter of each year as compared to
        the third and fourth quarters when manufacturers prepare for the major holiday
        selling season at the end of each year, which is traditionally the biggest
        quarter for consumer electronic retail sales.\u00a0 this seasonal trend may
        or may not continue in the future.\u00a0 accordingly, our results of operations
        may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.our business, financial condition
        and results of operations could be adversely affected by political and economic
        conditions in the countries in which we conduct business and our solutions
        are sold.we are exposed to general global economic and market conditions,
        particularly those impacting the  semiconductor industry. uncertainty about
        current global economic conditions may cause businesses to continue to postpone
        spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment or negative financial
        news.  this uncertainty  has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely
        affect, our business as service providers cut back or delay deployments that
        include our solutions and to the extent that consumers decrease their discretionary
        spending for enhanced video offerings from service providers, which may in
        turn lead to cautious or reduced spending by service providers and, in turn,
        may lead to a decrease in orders for our solutions, thereby adversely affecting
        our operating results. our operating results may also be adversely affected
        by changes in tax laws as governments react to address the gap between their
        spending outflows and tax revenue inflows.we may also experience adverse conditions
        in our cost base due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that reduce
        the purchasing power of the u.s. dollar, increase research and development
        expenses and otherwise harm our business. these conditions may harm our margins
        and prevent us from sustaining profitability if we are unable to increase
        the selling prices of our solutions or reduce our costs sufficiently to offset
        the effects of effective increases in our costs. our attempts to offset the
        effects of cost increases through controlling our expenses, passing cost increases
        on to our customers or any other method may not succeed.  25we are exposed
        to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency
        exchange rates, credit markets and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income
        securities. the primary objective of most of our investment activities is
        to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly
        increasing risk. to achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable investments
        are investment grade, liquid, fixed-income securities and money market instruments
        denominated in u.s. dollars. if the carrying value of our investments exceeds
        the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary,
        we will be required to write down the value of our investments, which could
        materially harm our results of operations and financial condition. moreover,
        the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio is affected
        by the credit condition of the u.s. financial sector. although there have
        been recent signs of improvement within the u.s. financial sector, the sector
        remains fragile and conditions may deteriorate rapidly, which could adversely
        affect the value, realized or unrealized, of our investments and cause us
        to record significant impairment losses.the success of our dbs odu solutions
        depends on the demand for our solutions within the satellite digital television
        market and the growth of this overall market.we derive a significant portion
        of our revenues from sales of our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit
        solutions into markets served by digital broadcast satellite providers and
        their odm and oem partners, the deployment of which may also increase demand
        for our moca-compliant connectivity solutions. these revenues result from
        the demand for hd based tv''s and dvr''s within single family households,
        multi dwelling units and hospitality establishments that receive their video
        from digital broadcast satellites. the digital broadcast satellite market
        may not grow in the future as anticipated or a significant market slowdown
        may occur, which would in turn reduce the demand for applications or devices,
        such as multi-switch and low-noise block converters that rely on our digital
        broadcast satellite outdoor unit solutions. because of the intense competition
        in the satellite, terrestrial and cable digital television markets, the unproven
        technology of many products addressing these markets and the short product
        life cycles of many consumer applications or devices, it is difficult to predict
        the potential size and future growth rate of the markets for our digital broadcast
        satellite outdoor unit solutions. if the demand for our digital broadcast
        satellite outdoor unit solutions is not as great as we expect, or if we are
        unable to produce competitive solutions to meet that demand, our revenues
        could be adversely affected.the market for our broadband access solutions
        is limited and these solutions may not be widely adopted.our broadband access
        solutions are designed to meet broadband access requirements in areas characterized
        by fiber optic network deployments that terminate within one kilometer of
        customer premises. we believe the primary geographic markets for our broadband
        access solutions are currently in china and in parts of europe where there
        are many multi-dwelling units and fiber optic networks that extend to or near
        a customer premises. we do not expect to generate significant revenues from
        sales of our broadband access solutions in north america, which is generally
        characterized by low-density housing, or in developing nations that do not
        generally have extensive fiber optic networks. to the extent our efforts to
        sell our broadband access solutions into currently targeted markets are unsuccessful,
        the demand for these solutions may not develop as anticipated or may decline,
        either of which could adversely affect our future revenues. moreover, these
        markets have a large number of service providers and varying regulatory standards,
        both of which may delay any widespread adoption of our solutions and increase
        the time during which competing technologies could be introduced and displace
        our solutions.in addition, if areas characterized by fiber optic networks
        that terminate within one kilometer of customer premises do not continue to
        grow, or we are unable to develop broadband access solutions that are competitive
        outside of these areas, the demand for our broadband access solutions may
        not grow and our revenues may be limited. even if the markets in which our
        broadband access solutions are targeted continue to grow or we are able to
        serve additional markets, customers and service providers may not adopt our
        technology. there are a growing number of competing technologies for delivering
        high-speed broadband access from the service provider\u2019s network to the
        customer\u2019s premises. for example, our broadband access solutions face
        competition from products using docsis, versions of dsl, ethernet, fiber to
        the home and lte solutions. moreover, there are many other access technologies
        that are currently in development including some low cost proprietary solutions.
        if service providers adopt competing products or technologies, the demand
        for our broadband access solutions will decline and we may not be able to
        generate significant revenues from these solutions. 26our restructuring activities
        could result in management distractions, operational disruptions and other
        difficulties.during 2013, we took steps to restructure and simplify our business
        and operations. specifically, we implemented plans to restructure portions
        of our business and to significantly reduce operating expenses, in part by
        implementing a reduction in our workforce. we cannot guarantee that we will
        be successful in implementing such initiatives, or that such efforts will
        not interfere with our ability to achieve our business objectives. to the
        extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities,
        this reduction in our workforce may impact our ability to accurately forecast
        future financial results or deliver on those projections. moreover, a reduction
        in force can be difficult to manage, may cause concerns from current and potential
        customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, may
        increase the likelihood of turnover of other key employees, and may have an
        adverse impact on our business. employees whose positions were eliminated
        in connection with these restructuring activities may seek employment with
        our competitors, customers or suppliers. although our employees are required
        to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time of hire, the confidential
        nature of certain proprietary information may not be maintained in the course
        of any such future employment. in addition, the implementation of expense
        reduction programs may result in the diversion of efforts of our executive
        management team and other key employees, which could adversely affect our
        business.we may not be able to effectively manage our growth, and we may need
        to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and
        control requirements of our growth, either of which could harm our business
        and operating results.as we continue to expand our business, we expect to
        grow the overall size of our operations. to effectively manage our growth,
        we must continue to expand our operational, financial and management controls,
        reporting systems and procedures.  further, our 2012 acquisition of the stb
        business from trident increased our international footprint and opened up
        new markets in which we had not previously operated. we intend to continue
        to grow our business geographically and also to develop new solution offerings
        and pursue new customers.  if we fail to adequately manage our growth the
        quality of our products and the management of our operations could suffer,
        which could adversely affect our operating results  our success in managing
        our growth will be dependent upon our ability to:\u2022enhance our operational,
        financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures;\u2022expand
        our facilities and equipment and develop new sources of supply for the manufacture,
        assembly and testing of our semiconductor solutions when and as needed and
        on commercially reasonable terms;\u2022successfully hire, train, motivate
        and productively deploy employees, including technical personnel; and\u2022expand
        our international resources.our inability to address effectively any of these
        factors, alone or in combination with others, could harm our ability to execute
        our business strategy.  in addition, we recently transitioned to a new enterprise
        resource planning, or erp, system. if the continued implementation of the
        new erp system does not proceed as expected or it the new erp system is deficient
        or inadequate in any material respect, it could impede our ability to manufacture
        products, order materials, generate management reports, invoice customers,
        and comply with laws and regulations. any of these types of disruptions could
        have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability. 27our joint
        development and technology licensing arrangements with customers, companies
        that we have investments in and other third parties may not be successful.we
        have entered into joint development, product collaboration and technology
        licensing arrangements with customers, companies we have investments in and
        other third parties, and we expect to enter into new arrangements of these
        kinds from time to time in the future. currently we have investments in, and
        various obligations and commitments to, third parties related to these arrangements.
        such arrangements can magnify several risks for us, including loss of control
        over the development and development timeline of jointly developed products.
        accordingly, we face increased risk that our joint development activities
        may result in products that are not commercially successful or that are not
        available in a timely fashion. in addition, any third party with whom we enter
        into a joint development, product collaboration or technology licensing arrangement
        may fail to commit sufficient resources to the project, change its policies
        or priorities and abandon or fail to perform its obligations related to the
        collaboration. the failure to timely develop commercially successful products
        through our joint development activities as a result of any of these and other
        challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
        operations, and financial condition. for example, in 2013 we terminated our
        development agreement with zenverge prior to any products becoming available
        from our joint development activities.any acquisition, strategic relationship,
        joint venture or investment could disrupt our business and harm our financial
        condition.we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions, strategic relationships,
        joint ventures, collaborations, technology licenses and investments that we
        believe may allow us to complement our growth strategy, increase market share
        in our current markets or expand into adjacent markets, or broaden our technology
        and intellectual property. such transactions, including our 2012 acquisitions
        of the stb business from trident and broadcast satellite intellectual property
        and our recently completed acquisition of assets from mobius are often complex,
        time consuming and expensive. we will need to overcome challenges, some of
        which may be significant, in order to realize the benefits or synergies from
        the acquisitions we have completed to date and any acquisitions we may complete
        from time to time in the future. such acquisitions present numerous challenges
        and risks including:\u2022difficulties in assimilating any acquired workforce
        and merging operations;\u2022attrition and the loss of key personnel or the
        impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers and customers;\u2022creating
        uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\u2022an
        acquired company, asset or technology, or a strategic collaboration or licensed
        asset or technology not furthering our business strategy as anticipated;\u2022uncertainty
        related to the value, benefits or legitimacy or intellectual property or technologies
        acquired in such transaction; \u2022the acquisition of a partner with which
        we have a joint venture, investment or strategic relationship by an unaffiliated
        third party that either delays or jeopardizes the original intent of the partnering
        relationship or investment;\u2022our overpayment for a company, asset or technology
        or changes in the economic or market conditions or assumptions underlying
        our decision to make an acquisition may subsequently make the acquisition
        less profitable or strategic than originally anticipated;\u2022our inability
        to liquidate an investment in a privately held company when we believe it
        is prudent to do so which results in a significant reduction in value or loss
        of our entire investment;\u2022difficulties entering and competing in new
        product categories or geographic markets and increased competition, including
        price competition;\u2022significant problems or liabilities, including increased
        intellectual property and employment related litigation exposure, associated
        with acquired businesses, assets or technologies;\u2022the need to use a significant
        portion of our available cash or issue additional equity securities that would
        dilute the then-current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in connection
        with any such transaction, or make unanticipated follow-on investments or
        incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities in an effort to preserve
        value in the initial transaction;\u2022requirements to devote substantial
        managerial and engineering resources to any strategic relationship, joint
        venture or collaboration, which could detract from our other efforts or significantly
        increase our costs; 28\u2022lack of control over the actions of our business
        partners in any strategic relationship, joint venture, collaboration or investment,
        which could significantly delay the introduction of planned solutions or otherwise
        make it difficult or impossible to realize the expected benefits of such relationship;
        and\u2022requirements to record substantial charges and amortization expense
        related to certain intangible assets, deferred stock-based compensation and
        other items.any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability
        to realize any benefit from our acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint
        ventures or investments after we have expended resources on them. the inability
        to integrate successfully any businesses we acquire, or any significant delay
        in achieving integration, could delay introduction of new solutions and require
        expenditure of additional resources to achieve integration.  further, acquisitions
        also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets
        that are subject to potential impairments, which could harm our financial
        results.we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions, relationships, joint
        ventures or investments that are not ultimately consummated. these negotiations
        could result in significant diversion of our management''s time, as well as
        substantial out-of-pocket costs, which could materially and adversely affect
        our operating results during the periods in which such costs are incurred.we
        cannot forecast the number, timing or size of future acquisitions, strategic
        relationships, joint ventures or investments, or the effect that any such
        transactions might have on our operating or financial results. any such transaction
        could disrupt our business and harm our operating results and financial condition.we
        may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic benefits from the
        businesses we acquire or be able to successfully integrate such businesses
        with ours.we will need to overcome challenges, some of which may be significant,
        in order to realize the benefits or synergies from the acquisitions we have
        completed to date and any acquisitions that we may complete from time to time
        in the future. these challenges include the following:\u2022integrating businesses,
        operations and technologies;\u2022retaining and assimilating key personnel;\u2022retaining
        existing customers and attracting additional customers;\u2022creating uniform
        standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems, including
        with respect to our expanded international operations;\u2022obtaining intellectual
        property rights, contractual rights or other rights or resources from third
        parties necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies associated
        with the acquired business;\u2022meeting the challenges inherent in efficiently
        managing an increased number of employees who may be located at geographic
        locations distant from our headquarters and senior management; and\u2022implementing
        appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs.integration
        in particular may involve considerable risks and may not be successful. these
        risks include the following:\u2022the potential disruption of our ongoing
        business and distraction of our management;\u2022the potential strain on our
        financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;\u2022unanticipated
        expenses and potential delays related to integration of the operations, technology
        and other resources of the acquired companies;\u2022the impairment of relationships
        with employees, suppliers and customers; and\u2022potential unknown or contingent
        liabilities.the inability to integrate successfully any businesses we acquire,
        or any significant delay in achieving integration, could delay introduction
        of new solutions and require expenditure of additional resources to achieve
        integration.investors should not rely on attempts to combine our historical
        financial results with those of any of our acquired businesses as separate
        operating entities to predict our future results of operations as a combined
        entity. 29the average selling prices of our solutions have historically decreased
        over time and will likely do so in the future, which may reduce our revenues
        and gross margin.our solutions and products sold by other companies in our
        industry have historically experienced a decrease in average selling prices
        over time. we anticipate that the average selling prices of our solutions
        will continue to decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing
        pressures, increased sales discounts and new product introductions from our
        competitors. for example, we expect that other chipset manufacturers who are
        members of moca will produce competing chipsets and create pricing pressure
        for such solutions. broadcom''s and others announcements about the availability
        of competing discrete moca chipsets and integrated moca socs in certain applications
        will put further pressure on pricing. our future operating results may be
        harmed due to the decrease of our average selling prices. to maintain our
        current gross margins or increase our gross margins in the future, we must
        develop and introduce on a timely basis new solutions and solution enhancements,
        continually reduce our solution costs and manage solution transitions in a
        timely and cost-effective manner. our failure to do so would likely cause
        our revenues and gross margins to decline, which could have a material adverse
        effect on our operating results and cause the value of our common stock to
        decline.fluctuations in the mix of solutions we sell may adversely affect
        our financial results.because of differences in selling prices and manufacturing
        costs among our solutions, the mix and types of solutions sold affect the
        average selling price of our solutions and have a substantial impact on our
        revenues and profit margins. to the extent our sales mix shifts toward increased
        sales of our relatively lower-margin solutions, our overall gross margins
        will be negatively affected. fluctuations in the mix and types of our solutions
        sold may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover our costs
        and expenditures associated with a particular solution, and as a result, can
        negatively impact our financial results.our solution development efforts are
        time-consuming, require substantial research and development expenditures
        and may not generate an acceptable return.our solution development efforts
        require substantial research and development expense. our research and development
        expense was $114.5 million and $98.4 million for the years ended december\u00a031,
        2013 and 2012, respectively. there can be no assurance that we will achieve
        an acceptable return on our research and development efforts.the development
        of our solutions is also highly complex. due to the relatively small size
        of our solution design teams, our research and development efforts in our
        core technologies may lag behind those of our competitors, some of whom have
        substantially greater financial and technical resources. in the past, we have
        occasionally experienced delays in completing the development and introduction
        of new solutions and solution enhancements, and we could experience delays
        in the future. unanticipated problems in developing solutions could also divert
        substantial engineering resources, which may impair our ability to develop
        new solutions and enhancements and could substantially increase our costs.
        furthermore, we may expend significant amounts on a research and development
        program that may not ultimately result in a commercially successful solution,
        and we have in the past terminated ongoing research and development programs
        before they could be brought to successful conclusions. as a result of these
        and other factors, we may be unable to develop and introduce new solutions
        successfully and in a cost-effective and timely manner, and any new solutions
        we develop and offer may never achieve market acceptance or an acceptable
        return on our investment. any failure to develop future solutions that are
        commercially successful would have a material adverse effect on our business,
        financial condition and results of operations.we continually evaluate the
        benefits, on a solution-by-solution basis, of migrating to higher performance
        or lower cost process technologies in order to produce higher performance,
        more efficient or better integrated circuits because we believe this migration
        is required to remain competitive. other companies in our industry have experienced
        difficulty in migrating to new process technologies and, consequently, have
        suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expense
        levels. we may experience similar difficulties. moreover, we are dependent
        on our relationships with subcontractors and the products of electronic design
        automation tool vendors to successfully migrate to newer or better process
        technologies. our third-party manufacturers may not make newer or better process
        technologies available to us on a timely or cost-effective basis, if at all.
        if our third-party manufacturers do not make newer or better manufacturing
        process technologies available to us on a timely or cost-effective basis,
        or if we experience difficulties or delays in migrating to these processes,
        it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and business
        prospects. 30our solutions typically have lengthy sales cycles, which may
        cause our operating results to fluctuate, and a service provider, odm or oem
        customer may decide to cancel or change its service or product plans, which
        could cause us to lose anticipated sales and expected revenue.our solutions
        typically have lengthy sales cycles. before deciding to deploy a product containing
        one of our solutions, a service provider must first evaluate our solutions.
        this initial evaluation period can vary considerably based on the service
        provider and solution being evaluated, and could take a significant amount
        of time to complete. solutions incorporating new technologies generally require
        longer periods for evaluation. after this initial evaluation period, if a
        service provider decides to adopt our solutions, that service provider and
        the applicable odm or oem customers will need to further test and evaluate
        our solutions prior to completing the design of the equipment that will incorporate
        our solutions. additional time is needed to begin volume production of equipment
        that incorporates our solutions. due to these lengthy sales cycles, we may
        experience significant delays from the time we incur research and development
        and sales expenses until the time, if ever, that we generate sales and revenue
        from these solutions. the delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase
        the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans.
        from time to time, we have experienced changes, delays and cancellations in
        the purchase plans of service providers or our customers. a cancellation or
        change in plans by a service provider, odm or oem customer could prevent us
        from realizing anticipated sales and the associated revenue. in addition,
        our anticipated sales could be lost or substantially reduced if a significant
        service provider, odm or oem customer reduces or delays orders during our
        sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our solutions.
        we may invest significant time and effort in marketing to a particular customer
        that does not ultimately result in a sale to that customer. as a result of
        these lengthy and uncertain sales cycles for our solutions, it is difficult
        for us to predict if or when our customers may purchase solutions in volume
        from us, our projected financial results may fluctuate and prove inaccurate,
        and our actual operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter,
        which may negatively affect our operating results for any given quarter.we
        have limited control over the indirect channels of distribution we utilize,
        which makes it difficult to accurately forecast orders and could result in
        the loss of certain sales opportunities.a portion of our revenue is realized
        through independent resellers and distributors that are not under our control.
        for the year ended december\u00a031, 2013, 3% of our net revenues were through
        these entities. for the year ended december 31, 2012, 5% of our net revenues
        were through these entities. these independent sales organizations generally
        represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce
        their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation
        of us. our revenues could be adversely affected if our relationships with
        resellers or distributors were to deteriorate or if the financial condition
        of one or more significant resellers or distributors were to decline. in addition,
        as our business grows, there may be an increased reliance on indirect channels
        of distribution. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining
        or expanding these indirect channels of distribution. this uncertainty could
        result in the loss of certain sales opportunities. furthermore, our reliance
        on indirect channels of distribution may reduce visibility with respect to
        future business opportunities, thereby making it more difficult to accurately
        forecast orders. further, we use the \u201csell-through\u201d accounting policy
        model which recognizes revenue only upon shipment of the merchandise from
        our distributor to the final customer. because we use the \u201csell-through\u201d
        methodology, we may have variability in our revenue from quarter to quarter.
        31if we do not achieve additional design wins in the future or if we do not
        complete our design-in activities before a customer\u2019s design window closes,
        our future sales and revenues could be adversely affected and our customer
        relationships could be harmed.to achieve design wins with oem customers and
        odms, we must define and deliver cost-effective, innovative and high performance
        solutions on a timely basis, before our competitors do so. in addition, the
        timing of our design-in activities with key customers and prospective customers
        may not align with their open design windows, which may or may not be known
        to us, making design win predictions more difficult. if we miss a particular
        customer\u2019s design window, we may be forced to wait an entire year or
        even longer for the next opportunity to compete for the customer\u2019s next
        design. the loss of a particular design opportunity could eliminate or substantially
        delay revenues from certain target customers and markets, which could have
        a material adverse effect on our results of operations and future prospects
        as well as our customer relationships. even after a design win, customers
        are not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce
        or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially
        successful, or for any other reason. we may not continue to achieve design
        wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could
        materially and adversely affect our operating results.our solutions must interoperate
        with many software applications and hardware found in service providers\u2019
        networks and other devices in the home, and if they do not interoperate properly
        our business would be harmed.our solutions must interoperate with service
        providers\u2019 networks and other devices in the home, which often have varied
        and complex specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, software
        applications and products from multiple vendors, and contain multiple generations
        of products that have been added over time. as a result, we must continually
        ensure that our solutions interoperate properly with existing and planned
        future networks. to meet these requirements, we must undertake development
        efforts that involve significant expense and the dedication of substantial
        employee resources. we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly
        or cost-effectively, if at all. if we fail to maintain or anticipate compatibility
        with products, software or equipment found in our customers\u2019 networks,
        we may face substantially reduced demand for our solutions, which would adversely
        affect our business, operating results and financial condition.from time to
        time, we may enter into collaborations or interoperability arrangements with
        equipment and software vendors providing for the use, integration or interoperability
        of their technology with our solutions. these arrangements would give us access
        to and enable interoperability with various products or technologies in the
        connected home entertainment market. if these relationships fail to achieve
        their goals, we would have to devote substantially more resources to the development
        of alternative solutions and the support of our existing solutions, or the
        addressable market for our solutions may become limited. in many cases, these
        parties are either companies that we compete with directly in other areas
        or companies that have extensive relationships with our existing and potential
        customers and may have influence over the purchasing decisions of these customers.
        a number of our competitors have stronger relationships than we do with some
        of our existing and potential customers and, as a result, our ability to have
        successful arrangements with these companies may be harmed. our failure to
        establish or maintain key relationships with third-party equipment and software
        vendors may harm our ability to successfully sell and market our solutions.
        we are currently devoting significant resources to the development of these
        relationships. our operating results could be adversely affected if these
        efforts do not result in the revenues necessary to offset these investments.in
        addition, if we find errors in the software or hardware used in service providers\u2019
        networks or problematic network configurations or settings we may have to
        modify our solutions so that they will interoperate with these networks. this
        could cause longer installation times for our solutions and order cancellations,
        either of which would adversely affect our business, operating results and
        financial condition. 32we do not have long-term commitments from our customers
        and our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or
        delay production, and if we fail to forecast demand for our solutions accurately,
        we may incur solution shortages, delays in solution shipments or excess or
        insufficient solution inventory.we sell our solutions to customers who integrate
        them into their products. we do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments
        from our customers. we have limited visibility as to the volume of our solutions
        that our customers are selling or carrying in their inventory. in addition,
        certain service providers are affected by seasonality in their deployment
        of products that incorporate our solutions, which may in turn impact the timing
        of our sales. because production lead times often exceed the amount of time
        required to fulfill orders, we often must build inventory in advance of orders,
        relying on an imperfect demand forecast to project volumes and solution mix.  our
        demand forecast accuracy, and our ability to manage our inventory carrying
        levels accurately, can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including
        inaccurate forecasting by our customers, changes in market conditions, adverse
        changes in our solution order mix and demand for our customers\u2019 products.
        we have in the past had customers dramatically decrease and increase their
        requested production quantities with little or no advance notice to us. even
        after an order is received, our customers may cancel these orders, postpone
        taking delivery or request a decrease in production quantities. any such cancellation,
        postponement of delivery or decrease in production quantity subjects us to
        a number of risks, most notably that our projected sales will not materialize
        on schedule or at all, leading to unanticipated revenue shortfalls, reduced
        profit margins and excess or obsolete inventory which we may be unable to
        sell to other customers or which we may be required to sell at reduced prices
        or write off entirely.  furthermore, changes to our customers'' requirements
        may result in disputes with our customers which could adversely impact our
        future relationships with those customers. alternatively, if we are unable
        to project customer requirements accurately, we may not build enough solutions,
        which could lead to delays in solution shipments and lost sales opportunities
        in the near term, as well as force our customers to identify alternative sources
        of supply, which could affect our ongoing relationships with these customers
        and potentially reduce our market share. if we do not timely fulfill customer
        demands, our customers may cancel their orders and we may be subject to customer
        claims for cost of replacement.our ability to accurately predict revenues
        and inventory needs, and to effectively manage inventory levels, may be adversely
        impacted due to our use of inventory \u201chubbing\u201d arrangements.we are
        party to inventory \u201chubbing\u201d arrangements with motorola and cisco
        and we may enter into similar arrangements with other customers in the future.
        pursuant to these arrangements, we ship our solutions to a designated third-party
        warehouse, or hub, rather than shipping them directly to the customer. the
        solutions generally remain in the hub until the customer removes them for
        incorporation into its own products. in the absence of any hubbing arrangement,
        we generally recognize revenues on sales of our solutions upon shipment of
        those solutions to the buyer. under a hubbing arrangement, however, we maintain
        ownership of our solutions in the hub, and therefore do not recognize the
        related revenue until the date our customer removes them from the hub. as
        a result, our ability to accurately predict future revenues recognized from
        sales to customers with which we implement hubbing arrangements may be impaired,
        and we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating
        results depending on when such customers remove our solutions from the hub,
        which they may do with little or no lead time. in the short term, we may experience
        an increase in operating expenses as we build and ship inventory to the hub
        and will not recognize revenues from sales of this inventory, if at all, until
        such customers remove it from the hub at a later time. furthermore, because
        we continue to own but do not maintain control over our solutions after they
        are shipped to the hub, our ability to effectively manage inventory levels
        may be impaired as our shipments under the hubbing arrangement increase and
        we may be exposed to additional risk that the inventory in the hub becomes
        obsolete before sales are recognized.we extend credit to our customers, sometimes
        in large amounts, but there is no guarantee every customer will be able to
        pay our invoices when they become due.as part of our routine business, we
        extend credit to customers purchasing our solutions. while our customers may
        have the ability to pay on the date of shipment or on the date credit is granted,
        their financial condition could change and there is no guarantee that customers
        will ever pay the invoices. rapid changes in our customers\u2019 financial
        conditions and risks associated with extending credit to our customers can
        subject us to a higher financial risk and could have a material adverse effect
        on our business, financial condition and results of operations. this risk
        is exacerbated by our reliance on a limited number of customers who purchase
        our solutions. 33we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture,
        assemble and test our solutions which reduces our control over key aspects
        of our solutions and their availability.we do not own or operate a manufacturing,
        assembly or test facility for our solutions. rather, we outsource the manufacture,
        assembly and testing of our solutions to third-party subcontractors including
        taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company, ltd., jazz semiconductor, inc.
        (a wholly owned subsidiary of tower semiconductor, inc.), amkor technologies,
        inc., advance semiconductor engineering group and giga solution tech. co.,
        ltd. further, the stb business relies heavily on nxp to manufacturer  certain
        stb solutions. accordingly, we are greatly dependent on a limited number of
        suppliers to deliver quality solutions on time. our reliance on sole or limited
        suppliers involves several risks, including susceptibility to increased manufacturing
        costs if competition for foundry capacity intensifies and reduced control
        over the following:\u2022supply of our solutions available for sale;\u2022pricing,
        quality and timely delivery of our solutions;\u2022prices and availability
        of components for our solutions; and\u2022production capacity for our solutions,
        including shortages due to the difficulties of suppliers to meet production
        capacities because of unexpected increases in demand.because we rely on a
        limited number of third-party manufacturers, if we elect to expand the number
        of third-party manufacturers to whom we outsource the manufacture, assembly
        or testing of our solutions, or if we are required to change contract manufacturers
        because any of our contract manufacturers become unable or unwilling to continue
        manufacturing our solutions for any reason, we may sustain lost revenues,
        increased costs and damage to our customer relationships or other harm to
        our business. any engagement of new or alternative third-party manufacturers  will
        require us to spend significant time and expense in identifying and qualifying
        such manufacturers and solutions manufactured by such manufacturers will,
        in turn, need to be qualified by our customers. the lead time required to
        establish a relationship with a new manufacturer is long, and it takes time
        to adapt a solution''s design and technological requirements to a particular
        manufacturer''s processes. in connection with our engagement of new or alternative
        third-party manufacturers, we may experience bugs and defects as we work through
        the process, which could result in delayed or decreased revenue and harm to
        our reputation and our relationship with our customers.manufacturing defects
        may not be detected by the testing process performed by our subcontractors.
        if defects are discovered after we have shipped our solutions, we may be exposed
        to warranty and consequential damages claims from our customers. such claims
        may have an adverse impact on our revenues and operating results. furthermore,
        if we are unable to deliver quality solutions, our reputation would be harmed,
        which could result in the loss of future orders and business with our customers.when
        demand for manufacturing capacity is high, we may take various actions to
        try to secure sufficient capacity, which may be costly and negatively impact
        our operating results.the ability of each of our supplier''s manufacturing
        facilities to provide us with chipsets is limited by its available capacity
        and existing obligations. although we may have purchase order commitments
        to supply products to our customers, we do not have a guaranteed level of
        production capacity from any of our suppliers\u2019 facilities to produce
        our solutions. facility capacity may not be available when we need it or at
        reasonable prices. in addition, our subcontractors may allocate capacity to
        the production of other companies\u2019 products and thereby reduce deliveries
        to us on short notice.in order to secure sufficient manufacturing facility
        capacity when demand is high and mitigate the risks associated with an inability
        to meet our customers\u2019 demands for our solutions, we may enter into various
        arrangements with suppliers that could be costly and harm our operating results,
        including:\u2022option payments or other prepayments to a supplier;\u2022nonrefundable
        deposits with or loans to suppliers in exchange for capacity commitments;\u2022contracts
        that commit us to purchase specified quantities of components over extended
        periods; and\u2022purchase of testing equipment for specific use at the facilities
        of our suppliers.we may not be able to make any such arrangements in a timely
        fashion or at all, and any arrangements may be costly, reduce our financial
        flexibility and not be on terms favorable to us. moreover, if we are able
        to secure capacity, we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur
        penalties. these penalties and obligations may be expensive and require significant
        capital and could harm our business. 34our solutions may contain defects or
        errors which may adversely affect their market acceptance and our reputation
        and expose us to product liability claims.our solutions are very complex and
        may contain defects or errors, especially when first introduced, when in full
        production, or when new versions are released. despite testing, errors may
        occur. such errors may include manufacturing defects, design defects of software
        bugs. solution errors could affect the performance of our solutions, delay
        the development or release of new solutions or new versions of solutions,
        adversely affect our reputation and our customers\u2019 willingness to buy
        solutions from us, and adversely affect market acceptance of our solutions.
        any such errors or delays in releasing new solutions or new versions of solutions
        or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue
        or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial
        costs in redesigning our solutions, subject us to liability for damages and
        divert our resources from other tasks. our solutions must successfully interoperate
        with products from other vendors. as a result, when problems occur in a device
        or application in which our solution is used, it may be difficult to identify
        the sources of these problems. the occurrence of hardware and software errors,
        whether or not caused by our solutions, could result in the delay or loss
        of market acceptance of our solutions, and therefore delay our ability to
        recognize revenue from sales, and any necessary revisions may cause us to
        incur significant expenses. moreover, problems with our solutions that are
        only discovered after they have been deployed by a service provider could
        result in a greater number of truck rolls, and this in turn could adversely
        affect our sales or increase the cost of remediation. the occurrence of any
        such problems could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.the
        use of our solutions also entails the risk of product liability claims. such
        claims may require us to incur additional development and remediation costs,
        pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts
        and purchase orders. we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims
        associated with the use of our solutions, but our insurance coverage may not
        cover any claim asserted against us adequately, or at all. in addition, even
        claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of
        funds in litigation which may divert our technical and other resources from
        solution development efforts and divert our management\u2019s time and other
        resources. any limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and
        conditions of sale may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as
        a result of federal, state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial
        decisions in the united states or other countries. we depend on key personnel
        to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel
        and hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully
        market our solutions could be harmed.we believe our future success will depend
        in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial,
        engineering and sales and marketing personnel. there is significant competition
        for qualified personnel in the markets in which we compete and in the geographical
        locations in which we operate. our inability to return to profitability, or
        any adverse perception of our company, our solutions and our products, may
        negatively affect our perceived reputation and make it more difficult or expensive
        to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. we do not have employment
        agreements with most of our executive or key employees and the unexpected
        loss of any key employees, including our president and chief executive officer,
        other members of our senior management or our senior engineering personnel,
        or an inability to attract additional qualified personnel, including engineers
        and sales and marketing personnel, could delay the development, introduction
        and sale of our solutions and our ability to execute our business strategy
        may suffer. in addition, in the event that there is a loss of any of our key
        personnel, there is a potential for loss of important knowledge that may delay
        or negatively impact development or sale of our solutions and our ability
        to execute on our business strategy. we do not currently have any key person
        life insurance covering any executive officer or employee. 35if we fail to
        comply with environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines
        or be required to suspend production or alter our manufacturing processes.we
        are subject to a variety of international, federal, state, and local governmental
        regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, generation, disposal,
        and labeling of toxic or other hazardous substances that make up the composition
        of many of our solutions. if we fail to comply with these regulations, substantial
        fines could be imposed on us, and we could be required to suspend production
        or alter manufacturing processes, either of which could have a negative effect
        on our sales, income, and business operations. failure to comply with environmental
        regulations could subject us to civil or criminal sanctions and property damage
        or personal injury claims. furthermore, environmental laws and regulations
        could become more stringent over time, imposing even greater compliance costs
        and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could
        seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations.new rules
        related to conflict minerals disclosure could negatively impact our business.the
        sec recently adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals
        in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements
        in the event that the materials come from, or could have come from, the democratic
        republic of the congo or adjoining countries. these new rules and verification
        requirements will impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and
        may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products.
        further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free,
        we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive
        disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.certain of our customers\u2019
        products and service providers\u2019 services are subject to governmental
        regulation.governmental regulation could place constraints on our customers
        and service providers\u2019 services and, consequently, reduce our customers\u2019
        demand for our solutions. for example, the federal communications commission
        has broad jurisdiction over products that emit radio frequency signals in
        the united states. similar governmental agencies regulate these products in
        other countries. moreover, laws and regulations regarding local cable franchising
        or satellite broadcasting rights could have an adverse effect on service providers\u2019
        ability to compete in the hd video and multimedia content delivery market.
        although most of our solutions are not directly subject to current regulations
        of the federal communications commission or any other federal or state communications
        regulatory agency, much of the equipment into which these solutions are incorporated
        is subject to direct governmental regulation. accordingly, the effects of
        regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may, in
        turn, impede sales of our solutions. for example, demand for these solutions
        will decrease if equipment into which they are incorporated fails to comply
        with the specifications of the federal communications commission. 36our effective
        tax rate may increase or fluctuate, and we may not derive the anticipated
        tax benefits from any expansion of our international operations.our effective
        tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are
        outside of our control. our effective tax rate is directly affected by the
        relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic
        and international jurisdictions in which we operate. we are also subject to
        changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions
        in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings. changes
        in applicable tax laws may cause fluctuations between reporting periods in
        which the changes take place. if our business opportunities outside the united
        states continue to grow, we may expand our international operations and staff
        to better support our expansion into international markets. we anticipate
        that this expansion will include the implementation of an international organizational
        structure that could result in an increasing percentage of our consolidated
        pre-tax income being derived from, and reinvested in, our international operations.
        moreover, we anticipate that this pre-tax income would be subject to foreign
        tax at relatively lower tax rates when compared to the u.s.\u00a0federal statutory
        tax rate and as a consequence, our future effective income tax rate may be
        lower than the u.s.\u00a0federal statutory rate. there can be no assurance
        that significant pre-tax income will be derived from or reinvested in our
        international operations, that our international operations and sales will
        result in a lower effective income tax rate, or that we will implement an
        international organizational structure. in addition, our future effective
        income tax rate could be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge any
        international tax structure that we implement or if the relative mix of u.s.
        and international income changes for any reason. accordingly, there can be
        no assurance that our effective income tax rate will be less than the u.s.
        federal statutory rate.changes in valuation allowance of deferred tax assets
        may affect our future operating results.we record a valuation allowance to
        reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more-likely-than-not
        to be realized. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider
        historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates
        of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies.
        on a periodic basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability.
        to the extent we believe it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of our
        deferred tax assets will not be realized, we will increase the valuation allowance
        against the deferred tax assets. realization of our deferred tax assets is
        dependent primarily upon future taxable income in related tax jurisdictions.
        if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the
        valuation allowances may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective
        increase or decrease in income tax expense.we assessed that it was more-likely-than-not
        that we will not realize our federal deferred tax assets based on the absence
        of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient
        taxable income in our united states tax jurisdiction to realize the deferred
        tax assets. accordingly, we recorded a valuation allowance on our federal
        deferred tax assets during the second quarter of 2013. our ability to utilize
        our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited, which
        could result in our payment of income taxes earlier than if we were able to
        fully utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.as of december\u00a031,
        2013, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $0.3 million
        and $32.1 million, respectively, and federal and state research and development
        tax credit carryforwards of $18.8 million and $20.0 million, respectively.
        the tax benefits related to utilization of net operating loss and tax credit
        carryforwards\u00a0may be limited due to ownership changes or as a result
        of other events.\u00a0for example, section\u00a0382 of the internal revenue
        code of 1986, as amended, imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net
        operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that may be used
        to offset federal taxable income and federal tax liabilities when a corporation
        has undergone a significant change in its ownership. while prior changes in
        our ownership of acquired entities have resulted in annual limitations on
        the amount of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may
        be utilized in the future, we do not anticipate that such annual limitations
        will preclude the utilization of substantially all the net operating loss
        and tax credit carryforwards described above in the event we remain profitable.
        however, to the extent our use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
        is further limited by future offerings or transactions or by our implementation
        of an international tax structure or other future events, our income would
        be subject to cash payments of income tax earlier than it would be if we were
        able to fully utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
        without such further limitation. 37we may not be able to obtain the financing
        necessary to operate and grow our business.we may require substantial funds
        to continue our research and development programs and to fulfill our planned
        operating goals. we anticipate that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable
        securities, investments and working capital at december 31, 2013 should enable
        us to maintain current and planned operations. our future capital requirements,
        however, may vary from what we currently expect. there are a number of factors
        that may affect our planned future capital requirements and accelerate our
        need for additional working capital, many of which are outside our control.
        we may seek additional funding through public or private financings of debt
        or equity although additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable
        terms, if at all. if we were to raise additional capital through further sales
        of our equity securities, our stockholders would suffer dilution of their
        equity ownership. if we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept
        terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, prohibit
        us from paying dividends, prohibit us from repurchasing our stock or making
        investments or force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any
        of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.risks
        related to our intellectual property our ability to compete and our business
        could be jeopardized if we are unable to secure or protect our intellectual
        property.we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade
        secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish
        and protect our proprietary rights. however, these legal means afford only
        limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us
        to gain or keep any competitive advantage. assuming the other requirements
        for patentability are met, currently, the first to file a patent application
        is generally entitled to the patent. however, prior to march 16, 2013, in
        the united states, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. patent
        applications in the u.s. and other jurisdictions are typically not published
        until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. therefore we cannot
        be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents
        or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent
        protection of such inventions. our issued patents and those that may issue
        in the future may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented,
        which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products.
        furthermore, although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property
        and proprietary technology by entering into nondisclosure agreements and intellectual
        property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors,
        such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection
        for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized
        use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements. moreover, we are required
        to license any of our patent claims that are essential to implement moca specifications
        to other moca members, who could potentially include our competitors, on reasonable
        and non-discriminatory licensing terms. in addition, in connection with commercial
        arrangements with our customers and the service providers who deploy equipment
        containing our solutions, we may be required to license our intellectual property
        to third parties, including competitors or potential competitors.despite our
        efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt
        to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trademarks, products or technology.
        monitoring unauthorized use of our trademarks and technology is difficult
        and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to prevent such unauthorized
        use will be successful, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may
        not protect our proprietary rights as comprehensively as in the united states.
        in addition, if we become aware of a third party''s unauthorized use or misappropriation
        of our trademarks or technology, it may not be practicable, effective or cost-efficient
        for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights, particularly
        where the initiation of a claim might harm our business relationships or risk
        a costly and protracted lawsuit, including a potential countersuit by a competitor
        with patents that may implicate our solutions. if competitors engage in unauthorized
        use or misappropriation of our trademarks or technology, our ability to compete
        effectively could be harmed. 38our participation in \u201cpatent pools\u201d
        and standards setting organizations, or other business arrangements, may require
        us to license our patents to competitors and other third parties and limit
        our ability to enforce or collect royalties for our patents.in addition to
        our existing obligations to license our patent claims that are essential to
        implement the moca specifications to other moca members, in the course of
        participating in patent pools and other standards setting organizations or
        pursuant to other business arrangements, we may agree to license certain of
        our technologies on a reasonable and non-discriminatory basis and, as a result,
        our control over the license of such technologies may be limited. we may also
        be unable to limit to whom we license some of our technologies and may be
        unable to restrict many terms of the license. consequently, our competitors
        may obtain the right to use our technology. in addition, our control over
        the application and quality control of our technologies that are included
        in patent pools or otherwise necessary for implementing industry standards
        may be limited.any dispute with a moca member regarding what patent claims
        are necessary to implement moca specifications could result in litigation
        which could have an adverse effect on our business.we are required to grant
        to other moca members a non-exclusive and world-wide license on reasonable
        and non-discriminatory terms to any of our patent claims that are essential
        to implement moca specifications. the meaning of reasonable and non-discriminatory
        has not been settled by the courts, and accordingly, it is not a well-defined
        concept. if we had a disagreement with a moca member regarding which of our
        patent claims are necessary to implement moca specifications or regarding
        whether the terms of any license by us under reasonable and non-discriminatory
        terms fall within the scope and meaning of reasonable and non-discriminatory,
        this could result in litigation. any such litigation, regardless of its merits,
        could be time-consuming, expensive to resolve, divert our management''s time
        and attention and harm our reputation. in addition, any such litigation could
        result in us being required to license on reasonable and non-discriminatory
        terms certain of our patent claims which we previously believed did not need
        to be licensed under our moca agreement. significant disagreements or any
        litigation between us and any moca member regarding patent claims necessary
        to implement moca or the scope and meaning of our reasonable and non-discriminatory
        terms could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our competitive
        position.possible third-party claims of infringement of proprietary rights
        against us, our customers or the service providers that purchase products
        from our customers, or other intellectual property claims or disputes, could
        have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
        condition.the semiconductor industry is characterized by a high level of litigation
        based on allegations of infringement of proprietary rights. numerous u.s.
        and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third
        parties exist in the fields in which we are selling and developing solutions.
        because patent applications take many years to issue, currently pending applications,
        known or unknown to us, may later result in issued patents that we infringe.
        in addition, third parties continue to actively seek new patents in our field.
        it is difficult or impossible to keep fully abreast of these developments
        and therefore, as we develop new and enhanced solutions, we may sell or distribute
        solutions that inadvertently infringe patents held by third parties. 39we
        have in the past received, and in the future we, our customers or the service
        providers that purchase products from our customers may receive, inquiries
        from other patent holders and may become subject to claims that we infringe
        their intellectual property rights. furthermore, we are, and may in the future
        be, engaged in development projects with technology partners that will result
        in the incorporation of technology contributed by us and our technology partners
        into one or more jointly developed products. accordingly, even if our own
        technology and stand-alone products do not infringe third party patents, the
        technology that is contributed by any of our technology partners, or the combination
        of our technology with that of our technology partners, may infringe third
        party patents, subjecting us through the use, manufacture, sale, offer for
        sale or importation of our solutions to claims that we infringe the intellectual
        property rights of others. any intellectual property claim or dispute, regardless
        of its merits, could force us, our customers or the service providers that
        purchase our solutions from our customers to license the third-party''s patents
        for substantial royalty payments or cease the sale of the alleged infringing
        products or use of the alleged infringing technologies, or force us to defend
        ourselves and possibly our customers or contract manufacturers in litigation.
        any cessation of solution sales by us, our customers or the service providers
        that purchase products from our customers could have a substantial negative
        impact on our revenues. any litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result
        in substantial expense and significant diversion of our management''s time
        and other resources. moreover, any such litigation could subject us, our customers
        or the service providers that purchase our solutions from our customers to
        significant liability for damages (including treble damages), temporary or
        permanent injunctions, or the invalidation of proprietary rights or require
        us, our customers or the service providers that purchase products from our
        customers to license the third-party patents for substantial royalty or other
        payments.in addition, we may also be required to indemnify our customers and
        contract manufacturers under our agreements if a third party alleges or if
        a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon, misappropriated
        or misused another party''s proprietary rights. we have received requests
        from certain customers to include increasingly broad indemnification provisions
        in our agreements with them. these indemnification provisions may, in some
        circumstances, extend our liability beyond the products we provide to include
        liability for combinations of components or system level designs and for consequential
        damages and/or lost profits. even if claims or litigation against us are not
        valid or successfully asserted, these claims could result in significant costs
        and diversion of the attention of management and other key employees to defend.finally,
        if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself,
        were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third
        party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture,
        import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es),
        either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our
        customers for our products. if such a decrease in demand for our products
        were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.our
        use of open source software and third-party technologies, including software,
        could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions.we
        incorporate open source software into our solutions, including certain open
        source code which is governed by the gnu general public license, lesser gnu
        general public license and common development and distribution license. these
        licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied,
        modified and distributed. it is possible that a court would hold these licenses
        to be unenforceable or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights
        in a program developed and distributed under them. . in such event, we could
        be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering
        our solutions, make our proprietary code generally available in source code
        form (for example, proprietary code that links in particular ways to certain
        open source modules), which could result in our trade secrets being disclosed
        to the public and the potential loss of intellectual property rights in our
        software, require us to re-engineer our solutions, discontinue the sale of
        our solutions if re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a cost-effective
        and timely basis, or become subject to other consequences, any of which could
        adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.in
        addition to technologies we have already licensed, we may find that we need
        to incorporate certain proprietary third-party technologies, including software
        programs, into our solutions in the future. however, licenses to relevant
        third-party technologies may not be available to us on commercially reasonable
        terms, if at all. therefore, we could face delays in solution releases until
        alternative technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated
        into our current solutions. such alternative technology may not be available
        to us on reasonable terms, if at all, and may ultimately not be as effective
        as the preferred technology. any such delays or failures to obtain licenses,
        if they occur, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results
        and financial condition. 40because we license some of our software source
        code directly to customers, we face increased risks that our trade secrets
        will be exposed through inadvertent or intentional disclosure, which could
        harm our competitive position or increase our costs.we license some of our
        software source code to our customers, which increases the number of people
        who have access to some of our trade secrets and other proprietary rights.
        contractual obligations of our licensees not to disclose or misuse our source
        code or not to reverse engineer our solutions may not be sufficient to prevent
        such disclosure or misuse. the costs of enforcing contractual rights could
        substantially increase our operating costs and may not be cost-effective,
        reasonable under the circumstances or ultimately succeed in protecting our
        proprietary rights. if our competitors access our source code or reverse engineer
        our solutions, they may gain further insight into the technology and design
        of our solutions, which would harm our competitive position.because we rely
        extensively on our information technology systems and network infrastructure,
        any disruption or infiltration of such systems could materially adversely
        affect our business.we maintain and rely extensively on information technology
        systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business.
        a disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems
        or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions,
        computer viruses, cyber attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions,
        natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss
        of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business.
        our security procedures, such as virus protection software and our business
        continuity planning, such as our disaster recovery policies and back-up systems,
        may not be adequate or implemented properly to fully address the adverse effect
        of such events, which could adversely impact our operations. in addition,
        our business could be adversely affected to the extent we do not make the
        appropriate level of investment in our technology systems as our technology
        systems become out-of-date or obsolete and are not able to deliver the type
        of data integrity and reporting we need to run our business. furthermore,
        when we implement new systems and or upgrade existing systems, we could be
        faced with temporary or prolonged disruptions that could adversely affect
        our business.risks related to international operationsa significant portion
        of our revenue comes from our international customers, most of our products
        are manufactured overseas and a significant portion of our employees live
        and work outside the united states.  as a result, our business may be harmed
        by political and economic conditions in foreign markets and the challenges
        associated with operating internationally.we have derived, and expect to continue
        to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from international markets.
        many of our customers in asia incorporate our chipsets into their products
        that are then sold to u.s.-based service providers. net revenues outside of
        the united states comprised 97% and 99% of our total revenues for the years
        ended december\u00a031, 2013 and 2012, respectively. in addition, most of
        our products are manufactured overseas and a significant portion of our labor
        force is outside the united states. our international presence has significantly
        increased in recent years as a result of our acquisition of the stb business
        from trident in 2012 and as a result our exposure to the risks of international
        business activities has increased. certain of these risks, include:\u2022difficulties
        involved in the staffing and management of geographically dispersed operations;\u2022complying
        with local laws and regulations, which are interpreted and enforced differently
        across jurisdictions and which can change significantly over time;\u2022longer
        sales cycles in certain countries, especially on initial entry into a new
        geographical market;\u2022greater difficulty evaluating a customer\u2019s
        ability to pay, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and greater difficulty
        in the collection of past-due accounts;\u2022general economic conditions in
        each country;\u2022challenges associated with operating in diverse cultural
        and legal environments;\u2022seasonal reductions in business activity specific
        to certain markets;\u2022loss of revenue, property and equipment from expropriation,
        natural disasters, nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism and other
        political risks;\u2022foreign taxes and the overlap of different tax structures,
        including modifications to the u.s. tax code as a result of international
        trade regulations;\u2022foreign technical standards;\u2022changes in currency
        exchange rates; and 41\u2022import and export licensing requirements, tariffs,
        and other trade and travel restrictions.to the extent our international sales
        are adversely affected by any of these risks or are otherwise unsuccessful,
        we could experience a reduction in revenue and our operating results could
        suffer.because we operate in jurisdictions in which local business practices
        may be inconsistent with international regulatory requirements, including
        anti-corruption and anti-bribery regulations prescribed under the u.s. foreign
        corrupt practices act, or fcpa, which, among other things, prohibits giving
        or offering to give anything of value with the intent to influence the awarding
        of government contracts. although we believe that we have adequate policies
        and enforcement mechanisms to ensure legal and regulatory compliance with
        the fcpa and other similar regulations, it is possible that some of our employees,
        subcontractors, agents or partners may violate any such legal and regulatory
        requirements, which may expose us to civil and/or criminal penalties and other
        sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
        condition and results of operations. if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory
        requirements, our business and reputation may be harmed.in addition, the laws
        that govern the protection of intellectual property rights in certain foreign
        countries where we sell our solutions, such as china and korea, can make recognition
        and enforcement of contractual and intellectual property rights more expensive
        and difficult than is the case in the united states. in particular, we may
        have difficulty preventing odms and oems in these countries from incorporating
        our inventions, technologies, copyrights or trademarks into their products
        without our authorization or without paying us licensing fees. we may also
        experience difficulty enforcing our intellectual property rights in these
        countries, where intellectual property rights are not as respected as they
        are in the united states, japan and europe. unauthorized use of our technologies
        and intellectual property rights may dilute or undermine the strength of our
        brand. further, if we are not able to adequately monitor the use of our technologies
        by foreign-based odms and oems, or enforce our intellectual property rights
        in foreign countries, our revenue potential could be adversely affected.our
        solutions are subject to export and import controls that could subject us
        to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.our
        solutions are subject to u.s. export controls and may be exported outside
        the united states only with the required level of export license or through
        an export license exception, in part because we incorporate encryption technology
        into our solutions. in addition, various countries regulate the import of
        certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability
        to distribute our solutions or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to
        implement our solutions in those countries. changes in our solutions or changes
        in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of
        our solutions in international markets, prevent our customers with international
        operations from deploying our solutions throughout their global systems or,
        in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries
        altogether. any change in export or import regulations or related legislation,
        or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations
        or legislation, could result in decreased use of our solutions by, or in our
        decreased ability to export or sell our solutions to, existing or potential
        customers internationally.in addition, we may be subject to customs duties
        and export quotas, which could have a significant impact on our revenue and
        profitability. the future imposition of significant increases in the level
        of customs duties or export quotas could have a material adverse effect on
        our business. 42substantially all of our solutions, and the products of many
        of our customers, are manufactured by third-party contractors located in the
        pacific rim, a region subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters,
        as well as economic and political instability. any disruption to the operations
        of these contractors could cause significant delays in the production or shipment
        of our solutions.substantially all of our solutions are manufactured by third-party
        contractors located in the pacific rim. the risk of an earthquake in this
        area is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines to
        the facilities of our foundry, assembly and test subcontractors. the occurrence
        of earthquakes or other natural disasters, or the occurrence of other catastrophic
        events such as a pandemic in the region, could result in the disruption of
        our foundry or assembly and test capacity or in the ability of our customers
        to purchase the raw materials or parts necessary to manufacture products,
        such as digital video recorders, or dvrs, into which our solutions are incorporated.
        in addition, many countries within the pacific rim have experienced, and continue
        to experience, periods of economic and political instability. any deterioration
        in the economic and political conditions in the pacific rim that disrupts
        the operations of our third-party contractors could also result in the disruption
        of our foundry or assembly and test capacity. any disruption caused by an
        earthquake or other catastrophic event or from the deterioration of economic
        and political conditions could cause significant delays in the production
        or shipment of our solutions until we are able to shift our manufacturing,
        assembling or testing from the affected contractor to another third-party
        vendor. we may not, and our customers may not, be able to obtain alternate
        capacity on favorable terms, if at all.as a result of our efforts to increase
        our sales in china, we are increasingly exposed to risks of doing business
        in china.we have a large stb product design center in shanghai, and we are
        particularly exposed to risks of doing business in china. we expect to continue
        to expand our business and operations in china. our success in the chinese
        markets may be adversely affected by china''s continuously evolving laws and
        regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs,
        currency controls, cross-border capital flows, environmental regulations,
        indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of
        those rights. enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent.
        in addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or
        u.s.-china relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their
        interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property,
        increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations,
        which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.
        further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in china may
        have a negative impact on our customers which would result in a negative impact
        on our business and results of operations.if our employees in china or india
        were to unionize, our operating costs with respect to our china or india operations
        would likely increase.we have expanded our operations and increased our employee
        headcount in china and india. one of the key benefits of having design centers
        in china and india are the relatively lower operating costs in those countries.
        our china and india employees are not currently represented by a collective
        bargaining agreement. however, we have no assurance that our china or india
        employees will not unionize, or be required by the government or other administrative
        authority to unionize or bargain collectively, in the future, which could
        increase our operating costs, limit our ability to hire and terminate employees
        in china or india on terms acceptable to us, force us to alter our operating
        methods in those countries and have a material adverse effect on our operating
        results in those countries.risks related to ownership of our common stockour
        stock price is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance,
        and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which
        you purchased such shares.the market price for our common stock is volatile
        and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of
        which we cannot control, including:\u2022price and volume fluctuations in
        the overall stock market;\u2022market conditions or trends in our industry
        or the economy as a whole;\u2022changes in operating performance and stock
        market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those that sell
        semiconductor products in particular; 43\u2022the timing of customer or service
        provider orders that may cause quarterly or other periodic fluctuations in
        our results that may, in turn, affect the market price of our common stock;\u2022the
        seasonal nature of the deployment of products that incorporate our solutions
        by certain service providers which may affect the timing of orders for our
        solutions;\u2022the timing of revenue recognition on sales arrangements, which
        may include multiple deliverables, and the effect of our use of inventory
        \u201chubbing\u201d arrangements;\u2022the financial projections we may provide
        to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these
        projections;\u2022changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities
        analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates
        or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common
        stock;\u2022the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements
        by us or third parties impacting us or our business, including our filings
        with the sec and announcements relating to solution development, litigation
        and intellectual property;\u2022the sustainability of an active trading market
        for our common stock;\u2022future sales of our common stock by our executive
        officers, directors and significant stockholders;\u2022announcements of mergers
        or acquisition transactions;\u2022market acceptance and understanding of our
        acquisitions; \u2022announcements of technical innovations, new products or
        design wins by our competitors or customers;\u2022other events or factors,
        including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters
        or responses to these events; and\u2022changes in accounting principles.in
        addition, the stock markets, and in particular nasdaq, have experienced extreme
        price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the
        market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. stock prices
        of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate
        to the operating performance of those companies. in the past, stockholders
        have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market
        volatility. if we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial
        costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted
        from our business.future sales of our common stock or the issuance of securities
        convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock may depress
        our stock price.sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock
        by stockholders, the issuance by the company of securities convertible into
        or exercisable for shares of our common stock, or the expectation or perception
        in the market that the holders of a large number of our shares of common stock
        intend to sell their shares, could significantly reduce the market price of
        our common stock. our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies
        with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading of a relatively
        small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading
        price for our stock and lead to increased volatility in our stock price.anti-takeover
        provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might deter acquisition
        bids for us that you might consider favorable.our amended and restated certificate
        of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition
        of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors.
        these provisions:\u2022establish a classified board of directors so that not
        all members of our board are elected at one time;\u2022authorize the issuance
        of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and
        shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may
        include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\u2022prohibit
        stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions
        to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\u2022provide that the board
        of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws;\u2022establish
        advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or
        for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder
        meetings; and 44\u2022provide that in addition to any vote required by law
        or by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the approval
        by holders of at least 66-2/3% of our then outstanding common stock is required
        to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of our amended and restated bylaws.in
        addition, because we are incorporated in delaware, we are governed by the
        provisions of section\u00a0203 of the delaware general corporation law which,
        subject to certain exceptions, prohibits stockholders owning in excess of
        15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. these
        anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage,
        delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company,
        even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. these provisions could also
        discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders
        to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions
        you desire.our principal stockholders, executive officers and directors have
        substantial control over the company, which may prevent you and other stockholders
        from influencing significant corporate decisions and may harm the market price
        of our common stock.as of december\u00a031, 2013, our executive officers,
        directors and holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock,
        beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 25.3% of our outstanding common stock.
        these stockholders may have interests that conflict with our other stockholders
        and, if acting together, have the ability to influence the outcome of matters
        submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal
        of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially
        all of our assets. accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the
        market price of our common stock by:\u2022delaying, deferring or preventing
        a change of control;\u2022impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other
        business combination involving us; or\u2022discouraging a potential acquirer
        from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.we
        do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.the continued
        expansion of our business will require substantial funding. accordingly, we
        do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common
        stock for the foreseeable future. any determination to pay dividends in the
        future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend
        upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions,
        restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors
        deems relevant. investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future
        should not purchase or hold our common stock. 45", "permalink_id": "c6023ca593e883981ce9c99eac06b1ef",
