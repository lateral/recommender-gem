        set used to write the text. In particular, the text can contain simple graphics
        or symbols. The key feature of our approach is that we first concentrate on
        finding the background of the text, before testing whether there is actually
        text on the background. Since uniform areas are easy to find in natural images,
        and since text backgrounds define areas which contain \"holes\" (where the
        text is written) we thus look for uniform areas containing \"holes\" and label
        them as text backgrounds candidates. Each candidate area is then further tested
        for the presence of text within its convex hull. We tested our method on a
        database of 65 images including English and Urdu text. The method correctly
        segmented all the text areas in 63 of these images, and in only 4 of these
        were areas that do not contain text also segmented. ", "permalink_id": "46d7d3364364c68d9429f5eee5c65ccb",

        observations in the theory of verse and empirical metrics have suggested that
        constructing a verse line involves a pattern-matching search through a source
        text, and that the number of found elements (complete words totaling a specified
        number of syllables) is given by dividing the total number of words by the
        mean number of syllables per word in the source text. This paper makes this
        latter point explicit mathematically, and in the course of this demonstration
        shows that the word length frequency totals in English output are distributed
        geometrically (previous researchers reported an adjusted Poisson distribution),
        and that the sequential distribution is random at the global level, with significant
        non-randomness in the fine structure. Data from a corpus of just under two
        million words, and a syllable-count lexicon of 71,000 word-forms is reported.
