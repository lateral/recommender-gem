        in a digitally processed image from data collected during a spacecraft flyby\nSpace
        exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures
        in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology
        . While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes
        , the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic
        probes and human spaceflight .\nWhile the observation of objects in space,
        known as astronomy , predates reliable recorded history , it was the development
        of large and relatively efficient rockets during the early 20th century that
        allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales
        for exploring space include advancing scientific research, uniting different
        nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military
        and strategic advantages against other countries.\nSpace exploration has often
        been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold
        War . The early era of space exploration was driven by a \" Space Race \"
        between the Soviet Union and the United States , the launch of the first manmade
        object to orbit the Earth , the USSR''s Sputnik 1 , on 4 October 1957, and
        the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 craft on 20 July 1969 are
        often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program
        achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in
        orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight ( Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1
        ) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Aleksei Leonov ) on 18 March 1965, the
        first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch
        of the first space station ( Salyut 1 ) in 1971.\nAfter the first 20 years
        of exploration, focus shifted from oneoff flights to renewable hardware, such
        as the Space Shuttle program , and from competition to cooperation as with
        the International Space Station (ISS).\nWith the substantial completion of
        the ISS [1] following STS133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by
        the USA remain in flux. Constellation , a Bush Administration program for
        a return to the Moon by 2020 [2] was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic
        by an expert review panel reporting in 2009. [3] The Obama Administration
        proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of
        the capability for crewed missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO), envisioning
        extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development
        of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing
        technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as Earth/Moon L1 , the Moon,
        Earth/Sun L2 , nearearth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit. [4] As of March
        2011, the US Senate and House of Representatives are still working towards
        a compromise NASA funding bill, which will probably terminate Constellation
        and fund development of a heavy lift launch vehicle (HLLV). [5]\nIn the 2000s,
        the People''s Republic of China initiated a successful manned spaceflight
        program , while the European Union , Japan, and India have also planned future
        manned space missions. China, Russia, Japan, and India have advocated manned
        missions to the Moon during the 21st century, while the European Union has
        advocated manned missions to both the Moon and Mars during the 21st century.\nFrom
        the 1990s onwards, private interests began promoting space tourism and then
        private space exploration of the Moon (see Google Lunar X Prize ).\nContents\nSee
        also: Timeline of space exploration , History of astronomy and Timeline of
        first orbital launches by country\nMost orbital flight actually takes place
        in upper layers of the atmosphere, especially in the thermosphere (not to
        scale)\nIn July 1950 the first Bumper rocket is launched from Cape Canaveral,
        Florida. The Bumper was a twostage rocket consisting of a PostWar V2 topped
        by a WAC Corporal rocket. It could reach thenrecord altitudes of almost 400
        km. Launched by General Electric Company, this Bumper was used primarily for
        testing rocket systems and for research on the upper atmosphere. They carried
        small payloads that allowed them to measure attributes including air temperature
        and cosmic ray impacts.\nThe first steps of putting a manmade object into
        space were taken by German scientists during World War II while testing the
        V2 rocket, which became the first manmade object in space on 3 October 1942
        with the launching of the A4 . After the war, the U.S. used German scientists
        and their captured rockets in programs for both military and civilian research.
        The first scientific exploration from space was the cosmic radiation experiment
        launched by the U.S. on a V2 rocket on 10 May 1946. [6] The first images of
        Earth taken from space followed the same year [7] [8] while the first animal
        experiment saw fruit flies lifted into space in 1947, both also on modified
        V2s launched by Americans. Starting in 1947, the Soviets, also with the help
        of German teams, launched suborbital V2 rockets and their own variant, the
        R1 , including radiation and animal experiments on some flights. These suborbital
        experiments only allowed a very short time in space which limited their usefulness.\nFirst
        flights[ edit ]\nSputnik 1 , the first artificial satellite orbited earth
        at 939 to 215 km (583 to 134 mi) in 1957, and was soon followed by Sputnik
        2 . See First satellite by country (Replica Pictured)\nApollo CSM in lunar
        orbit\nApollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt standing next to a boulder at
        TaurusLittrow.\nThe first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet unmanned
        Sputnik 1 (\"Satellite 1\") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed
        about 83 kg (183 lb), and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of
        about 250 km (160 mi). It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40 MHz), which
        emitted \"beeps\" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis
        of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density
        of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the
        duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not
        punctured by a meteoroid . Sputnik 1 was launched by an R7 rocket. It burned
        up upon reentry on 3 January 1958.\nThis success led to an escalation of the
        American space program , which unsuccessfully attempted to launch a Vanguard
        satellite into orbit two months later. On 31 January 1958, the U.S. successfully
        orbited Explorer 1 on a Juno rocket. In the meantime, the Soviet dog Laika
        became the first animal in orbit on 3 November 1957.\nFirst human flights[
        edit ]\nThe first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 (\"East 1\"),
        carrying 27 year old Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. The
        spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and
        48 minutes. Gagarin''s flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration
        of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in
        space exploration: human spaceflight .\nThe U.S. first launched a person into
        space within a month of Vostok 1 with Alan Shepard ''s suborbital flight in
        MercuryRedstone 3 . Orbital flight was achieved by the United States when
        John Glenn ''s MercuryAtlas 6 orbited the Earth on 20 February 1962.\nValentina
        Tereshkova , the first woman in space, orbited the Earth 48 times aboard Vostok
        6 on 16 June 1963.\nChina first launched a person into space 42 years after
        the launch of Vostok 1, on 15 October 2003, with the flight of Yang Liwei
        aboard the Shenzhou 5 (Spaceboat 5) spacecraft.\nFirst planetary explorations[
        edit ]\nThe first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna
        2 in 1959. [9] The first automatic landing on another celestial body was performed
        by Luna 9 [10] in 1966. Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the
        Moon. [11]\nThe first manned landing on another celestial body was performed
        by Apollo 11 in its lunar landing on 20 July 1969.\nThe first successful interplanetary
        flyby was the 1962 Mariner 2 flyby of Venus (closest approach 34,773 kilometers).
        Flybys for the other planets were first achieved in 1965 for Mars by Mariner
        4 , 1973 for Jupiter by Pioneer 10 , 1974 for Mercury by Mariner 10 , 1979
        for Saturn by Pioneer 11 , 1986 for Uranus by Voyager 2 , and 1989 for Neptune
        by Voyager 2.\nThe first interplanetary surface mission to return at least
        limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of Venera 7
        on Venus which returned data to earth for 23 minutes. In 1971 the Mars 3 mission
        achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds.
        Later much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over
        6 years of Mars surface operation by Viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over 2
        hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera 13 in 1982, the
        longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission.\nKey people in early space
        exploration[ edit ]\nThe dream of stepping into the outer reaches of the Earth''s
        atmosphere was driven by the fiction of Jules Verne [12] [13] [14] and H.G.Wells
        , [15] and rocket technology was developed to try to realise this vision.
        The German V2 was the first rocket to travel into space, overcoming the problems
        of thrust and material failure. During the final days of World War II this
        technology was obtained by both the Americans and Soviets as were its designers.
        The initial driving force for further development of the technology was a
        weapons race for intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) to be used
        as longrange carriers for fast nuclear weapon delivery, but in 1961 when USSR
        launched the first man into space, the U.S. declared itself to be in a \"
        Space Race \" with the Soviets.\nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky , Robert Goddard ,
        Hermann Oberth , and Reinhold Tiling laid the groundwork of rocketry in the
        early years of the 20th century.\nWernher von Braun was the lead rocket engineer
        for Nazi Germany''s World War II V2 rocket project. In the last days of the
        war he led a caravan of workers in the German rocket program to the American
        lines, where they surrendered and were brought to the USA to work on U.S.
        rocket development (\" Operation Paperclip \"). He acquired American citizenship
        and led the team that developed and launched Explorer 1 , the first American
        satellite. Von Braun later led the team at NASA ''s Marshall Space Flight
        Center which developed the Saturn V moon rocket.\nInitially the race for space
        was often led by Sergei Korolyov , whose legacy includes both the R7 and Soyuz
        \u2014which remain in service to this day. Korolev was the mastermind behind
        the first satellite, first man (and first woman) in orbit and first spacewalk.
        Until his death his identity was a closely guarded state secret; not even
        his mother knew that he was responsible for creating the Soviet space program.\nKerim
        Kerimov was one of the founders of the Soviet space program and was one of
        the lead architects behind the first human spaceflight ( Vostok 1 ) alongside
        Sergey Korolyov. After Korolyov''s death in 1966, Kerimov became the lead
        scientist of the Soviet space program and was responsible for the launch of
        the first space stations from 1971 to 1991, including the Salyut and Mir series,
        and their precursors in 1967, the Cosmos 186 and Cosmos 188 . [16] [17]\nOther
        key people[ edit ]\nValentin Glushko held the role of Chief Engine Designer
        for USSR. Glushko designed many of the engines used on the early Soviet rockets,
        but was constantly at odds with Korolyov.\nVasily Mishin was Chief Designer
        working under Sergey Korolyov and one of first Soviets to inspect the captured
        German V2 design. Following the death of Sergei Korolev, Mishin was held responsible
        for the Soviet failure to be first country to place a man on the moon.\nRobert
        Gilruth was the NASA head of the Space Task Force and director of 25 manned
        space flights. Gilruth was the person who suggested to John F. Kennedy that
        the Americans take the bold step of reaching the Moon in an attempt to reclaim
        space superiority from the Soviets.\nChristopher C. Kraft, Jr. was NASA''s
        first flight director , who oversaw development of Mission Control and associated
        technologies and procedures.\nMaxime Faget was the designer of the Mercury
        capsule; he played a key role in designing the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft,
        and contributed to the design of the Space Shuttle .\nTargets of exploration[
        edit ]\nThe Sun[ edit ]\nWhile the Sun will probably not be physically explored
        in the close future, one of the reasons for going into space is to know more
        about the Sun. Once above the atmosphere in particular and the Earth''s magnetic
        field, this gives access to the Solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations
        that cannot reach the surface of the Earth. The Sun generates most space weather
        , which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and
        interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes.\nMESSENGER image
        of Mercury\nMain article: Exploration of Mercury\nMercury remains the least
        explored of the inner planets . As of May 2013, the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER
        missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of
        Mercury. MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further
        investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b).\nA
        MESSENGER image from 18,000 km showing a region about 500 km across\nA third
        mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2020, BepiColombo is to include
        two probes . BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the European
        Space Agency . MESSENGER and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary
        data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner
        10''s flybys .\nFlights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished
        at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the
        spacecraft, or deltav . Due to the relatively high deltav to reach Mercury
        and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around
        it are rather unstable.\nMain article: Observations and explorations of Venus\nVenus
        was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite
        one of the most hostile surface environments in the solar system, has had
        more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other
        planet in the solar system. The first successful Venus flyby was the American
        Mariner 2 spacecraft, which flew past Venus in 1962. Mariner 2 has been followed
        by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions
        using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial
        bodies. In 1967 Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine
        the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970 Venera 7 became the first successful lander
        to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional
        successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface
        data. Starting in 1975 with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9 some ten successful
        orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were
        able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere.\nThe
        \"marble\" Earth picture taken by Apollo 17\nFirst television image of Earth
        from space\nMain article: Earth observation satellite\nSpace exploration has
        been used as a tool to understand the Earth as a celestial object in its own
        right. Orbital missions can provide data for the Earth that can be difficult
        or impossible to obtain from a purely groundbased point of reference.\nFor
        example, the existence of the Van Allen belts was unknown until their discovery
        by the United States'' first artificial satellite, Explorer 1 . These belts
        contain radiation trapped by the Earth''s magnetic fields, which currently
        renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical.
        Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation
        satellites have been deployed specifically to explore the Earth from a space
        based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the
        understanding of a variety of earth based phenomena. For instance, the hole
        in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring
        Earth''s atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological
        sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise
        identify.\nThe Moon as seen from the Earth\nMain article: Exploration of the
        Moon\nEarth''s Moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space
        exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial
        object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only
        remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans.\nIn 1959 the Soviets
        obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon , never previously visible
        to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger 4 impactor
        in 1962. Starting in 1966 the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers
        to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon''s surface;
        just four months later, Surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series
        of U.S. landers. The Soviet unmanned missions culminated in the Lunokhod program
        in the early ''70s which included the first unmanned rovers and also successfully
        returned lunar soil samples to the Earth for study. This marked the first
        (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to
        the Earth. Unmanned exploration of the Moon continues with various nations
        periodically deploying lunar orbiters, and in 2008 the Indian Moon Impact
        Probe .\nManned exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the Apollo 8 mission
        that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object
        was orbited by humans. In 1969 the Apollo 11 mission marked the first time
        humans set foot upon another world. Manned exploration of the Moon did not
        continue for long, however. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the most
        recent human visit there, and the next, Exploration Mission 2 , is due to
        orbit the Moon in 2019. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously.\nMars
        as seen by the HST\nSurface of mars by the Spirit rover in 2004\nMain article:
        Exploration of Mars\nThe exploration of Mars has been an important part of
        the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United
        States, Europe, and Japan. Dozens of robotic spacecraft , including orbiters
        , landers , and rovers , have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These
        missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering
        questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific
        community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet
        but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth.\nThe
        exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly
        twothirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their
        missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate
        can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved
        in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of
        The Great Galactic Ghoul [18] which subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This
        phenomenon is also informally known as the Mars Curse . [19]\nMain article:
        Exploration of Phobos\nThe Russian space mission FobosGrunt , which launched
        on 9 November 2011 experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth
        orbit . [20] It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial
        orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a
        \"transshipment point\" for spaceships travelling to Mars. [21]\nImage of
        Io taken by the Galileo spacecraft\nThe exploration of Jupiter has consisted
        solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since
        1973. A large majority of the missions have been \"flybys\", in which detailed
        observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; the Galileo
        spacecraft is the only one to have orbited the planet. As Jupiter is believed
        to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing
        mission is nearly impossible.\nReaching Jupiter from Earth requires a deltav
        of 9.2 km/s, [22] which is comparable to the 9.7 km/s deltav needed to reach
        low Earth orbit. [23] Fortunately, gravity assists through planetary flybys
        can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit
        at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration. [22]\nJupiter has over
        60 known moons , many of which have relatively little known information about
        them.\nA picture of Saturn taken by Voyager 2 .\nHuygens image from the surface
        of Titan\nMain article: Exploration of Saturn\nSaturn has been explored only
        through unmanned spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission ( Cassini\u2013Huygens
        ) planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions
        consist of flybys in 1979 by Pioneer 11 , in 1980 by Voyager 1 , in 1982 by
        Voyager 2 and an orbital mission by the Cassini spacecraft which entered orbit
        in 2004 and is expected to continue its mission well into 2012.\nSaturn has
        at least 62 known moons , although the exact number is debatable since Saturn''s
        rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying
        sizes. The largest of the moons is Titan . Titan holds the distinction of
        being the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere denser and thicker
        than that of the Earth. As a result of the deployment from the Cassini spacecraft
        of the Huygens probe and its successful landing on Titan, Titan also holds
        the distinction of being the only moon (apart from Earth''s own Moon) to be
        successfully explored with a lander.\nUranus from Voyager 2\nMain article:
        Exploration of Uranus\nThe exploration of Uranus has been entirely through
        the Voyager 2 spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given its
        axial tilt of 97.77\u00b0, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness
        for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest
        approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986. Voyager 2 studied the planet''s
        unique atmosphere and magnetosphere . Voyager 2 also examined its ring system
        and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons,
        while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons.\nImages of Uranus
        proved to have a very uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic
        storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort
        was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The
        magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be completely unique and proved
        to be profoundly affected by the planet''s unusual axial tilt. In contrast
        to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of
        the moons of Uranus, including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically
        active.\nPicture of Neptune taken by Voyager 2\nTriton as imaged by Voyager
        2\nMain article: Exploration of Neptune\nThe exploration of Neptune began
        with the 25 August 1989 Voyager 2 flyby, the sole visit to the system as of
        2014. The possibility of a Neptune Orbiter has been discussed, but no other
        missions have been given serious thought.\nAlthough the extremely uniform
        appearance of Uranus during Voyager 2''s visit in 1986 had led to expectations
        that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, Voyager 2
        found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, auroras , and even
        a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiter''s
        small Spot. Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in
        the solar system, measured as high as 2,100 km/h. [24] Voyager 2 also examined
        Neptune''s ring and moon system. It discovered 900 complete rings and additional
        partial ring \"arcs\" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune''s
        three previously known moons, Voyager 2 also discovered five previously unknown
        moons, one of which, Proteus , proved to be the last largest moon in the system.
        Data from Voyager further reinforced the view that Neptune''s largest moon,
        Triton , is a captured Kuiper belt object. [25]\nOther objects in the Solar
        system[ edit ]\nMain article: Exploration of Pluto\nPluto and Charon (1994)\nThe
        dwarf planet Pluto (considered a planet until the IAU redefined \"planet\"
        in October 2006 [26] ) presents significant challenges for spacecraft because
        of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip
        times) and small mass (making capture into orbit very difficult at present).
        Voyager 1 could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close
        flyby of Saturn''s moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with
        a Pluto flyby. Voyager 2 never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto.
        [27]\nPluto continues to be of great interest, despite its reclassification
        as the lead and nearest member of a new and growing class of distant icy bodies
        of intermediate size, in mass between the remaining eight planets and the
        small rocky objects historically termed asteroids (and also the first member
        of the important subclass, defined by orbit and known as \" Plutinos \").
        After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbed New Horizons
        was granted funding from the US government in 2003. [28] New Horizons was
        launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use
        of a gravity assist from Jupiter . Its closest approach to Pluto will be on
        14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto will begin five months prior
        to closest approach and will continue for at least a month after the encounter.\nAsteroids
        and comets[ edit ]\nComet 103P/Hartley\nAsteroid 4 Vesta, imaged by the Dawn
        spacecraft\nUntil the advent of space travel , objects in the asteroid belt
        were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes
        and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by
        probes, the first of which was Galileo , which flew past two: 951 Gaspra in
        1991, followed by 243 Ida in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to Galileo''s
        planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost.
        The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the NEAR Shoemaker probe
        in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object. The dwarf planet Ceres
        and the asteroid 4 Vesta , two of the three largest asteroids, are targets
        of NASA''s Dawn mission , launched in 2007.\nWhile many comets have been closely
        studied from Earth sometimes with centuriesworth of observations, only a few
        comets have been closely visited. In 1985, the International Cometary Explorer
        conducted the first comet flyby ( 21P/GiacobiniZinner ) before joining the
        Halley Armada studying the famous comet. The Deep Impact probe smashed into
        9P/Tempel to learn more about its structure and composition while the Stardust
        mission returned samples of another comet''s tail. The Philae lander successfully
        landed on comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko in 2014 as part of the broader
        Rosetta mission.\nHayabusa was an unmanned spacecraft developed by the Japan
        Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from a small nearEarth
        asteroid named 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched
        on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in midSeptember 2005. After arriving
        at Itokawa, Hayabusa studied the asteroid''s shape, spin, topography, colour,
        composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid
        to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010.\nDeep
        space exploration[ edit ]\nFuture of space exploration[ edit ]\nConcept art
        for a NASA Vision mission\nThe examples and perspective in this section may
        not represent a worldwide view of the subject. Please improve this article
        and discuss the issue on the talk page .\n(September 2013)\nIn the 2000s,
        several plans for space exploration were announced; both government entities
        and the private sector have space exploration objectives. China has announced
        plans to have a 60ton multimodule space station in orbit by 2020.\nThe NASA
        Authorization Act of 2010 provides objectives for American space exploration.
        NASA proposes to move forward with the development of the Space Launch System
        (SLS), which will be designed to carry the Orion MultiPurpose Crew Vehicle,
        as well as important cargo, equipment, and science experiments to Earth''s
        orbit and destinations beyond. Additionally, the SLS will serve as a back
        up for commercial and international partner transportation services to the
        International Space Station. The SLS rocket will incorporate technological
        investments from the Space Shuttle program and the Constellation program in
        order to take advantage of proven hardware and reduce development and operations
        costs. The first developmental flight is targeted for the end of 2017. [29]\nAI
        in Space Exploration[ edit ]\nThe idea of using high level automated systems
        for space missions has become a desirable goal to space agencies all around
        the world. Such systems are believed to yield benefits such as lower cost,
        less human oversight, and ability to explore deeper in space which is usually
        restricted by long communications with human controllers. [30]\nAutonomous
        System[ edit ]\nAutonomy is defined by 3 requirements: [30]\nBeing able to
        sense the world and their state, make decisions, and carry them out on their
        own\nCan interpret the given goal as a list of actions to take\nFail flexibly\nBenefits[
        edit ]\nAutonomed technologies would be able to perform beyond predetermined
        actions. It would analyze all possible states and events happening around
        them and come up with a safe response. In addition, such technologies can
        reduce launch cost and ground involvement. Performance would increase as well.
        Autonomy would be able to quickly respond upon encountering an unforeseen
        event, especially in deep space exploration where communication back to Earth
        would take too long. [30]\nNASA\u2019s Autonomous Science Experiment[ edit
        ]\nNASA began its autonomous science experiment (ASE) on the Earth Observing
        1 (EO1) which is NASA\u2019s first satellite in the new millennium program
        Earth observing series launched on 21 November 2000. The autonomy of ASE is
        capable of onboard science analysis, replanning, robust execution, and later
        the addition of modelbased diagnostic. Images obtained by the EO1 are analyzed
        onboard and downlinked when a change or an interesting event occur. The ASE
        software has successfully provided over 10,000 science images. [30]\nMain
        article: Space advocacy\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin , had a personal Communion
        service when he first arrived on the surface of the Moon .\nThe research that
        is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as NASA and Roscosmos
        , is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic
        analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such
        as NASA spinoffs ), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program.
        [31] It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction
        of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions
        of dollars worth of minerals and metals. The revenue generated from such expeditions
        could generate a lot of revenue. [32] As well, it has been argued that space
        exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering.
        [33]\nAnother claim is that space exploration is a necessity to mankind and
        that staying on Earth will lead to extinction . Some of the reasons are lack
        of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic. Stephen
        Hawking , renowned British theoretical physicist, said that \"I don''t think
        the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into
        space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet.
        But I''m an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.\" [34]\nNASA has produced
        a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space
        exploration. [35]\nOverall, the public remains largely supportive of both
        manned and unmanned space exploration. According to an Associated Press Poll
        conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that
        the space program is \"a good investment\", compared to 21% who did not. [36]\nArthur
        C. Clarke (1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration
        of space in his nonfiction semitechnical monograph Interplanetary Flight.
        [37] He argued that humanity''s choice is essentially between expansion off
        the Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation
        and death.\nMain article: Spaceflight\nSpaceflight is the use of space technology
        to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space.\nSpaceflight
        is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space
        tourism and satellite telecommunications . Additional noncommercial uses of
        spaceflight include space observatories , reconnaissance satellites and other
        earth observation satellites .\nA spaceflight typically begins with a rocket
        launch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity
        and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth. Once in space, the
        motion of a spacecraft\u2014both when unpropelled and when under propulsion\u2014is
        covered by the area of study called astrodynamics . Some spacecraft remain
        in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry , and
        others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.\nMain article:
        Satellite\nSatellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types
        include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication
        satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites.
        Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites.\nCommercialization
        of space[ edit ]\nMain articles: Astrobiology and Extraterrestrial life\nAstrobiology
        is the interdisciplinary study of life in the universe, combining aspects
        of astronomy , biology and geology. [38] It is focused primarily on the study
        of the origin , distribution and evolution of life. It is also known as exobiology
        (from Greek: \u03ad\u03be\u03c9, exo, \"outside\"). [39] [40] [41] The term
        \"Xenobiology\" has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because
        its terminology means \"biology of the foreigners\". [42] Astrobiologists
        must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct
        from any life found on earth. [43] In the Solar System some of the prime locations
        for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan.
        [44]\nLiving in space[ edit ]\nThe European Space Agency ''s Columbus Module
        at the International Space Station , launched into space on the U.S. Space
        Shuttle mission STS122 in 2008\nSpace colonization, also called space settlement
        and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (selfsufficient)
        human habitation of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites
        or planets such as the Moon or Mars , using significant amounts of insitu
        resource utilization .\nTo date, the longest human occupation of space is
        the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for 700114000000000000014
        years, 700136000000000000036 days. Valeri Polyakov ''s record single spaceflight
        of almost 438 days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed. Longterm
        stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune
        system suppression, and radiation exposure.\nMany past and current concepts
        for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return
        to the Moon as a \"stepping stone\" to the other planets, especially Mars.
        At the end of 2006 NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent
        Moon base with continual presence by 2024. [45]\nBeyond the technical factors
        that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that
        the lack of private property , the inability or difficulty in establishing
        property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space
        for human habitation. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half
        of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky,
        with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of national
        territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically
        proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty , which had been, as of 2012 [update]
        , ratified by all spacefaring nations . [46]", "created_at": "2015-02-05 15:34:54.829682",
