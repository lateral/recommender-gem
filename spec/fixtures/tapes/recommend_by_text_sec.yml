        long-term business strategy includes two components: (1)\u00a0grow revenue
        from our core satellite imagery products and services; and (2)\u00a0grow revenue
        from our emerging higher value information products derived from our imagery,
        geospatial analytic software and expert services to obtain insight from our
        imagery. the key elements that we believe will enable us to achieve our long-term
        business strategy both through organic growth and through acquisitions include:\\n\u00a0\\nrealize

        contract (\u0093enhancedview contract\u0094) with the united states national
        geospatial-intelligence agency (\u0093nga\u0094), which we signed in august\u00a02010,
        contains multiple deliverables, including a service level agreement (\u0093enhancedview
        sla\u0094), infrastructure enhancements and other services. our enhancedview
        contract has a full potential value of $3.6\u00a0billion over the ten year
        life of the contract.\u00a0 the services we provide under this contract enable
        the u.s. government to serve war-fighters, intelligence officers, first responders
        and other government users of imagery.\u00a0 in addition, we expect to continue
        to add to our capabilities to more deeply integrate ourselves into the u.s.
        government\u0092s imagery-related work flow, including more web-based, valued-added
        imagery services providing an integrated operational connection with the u.s.

        and securely. the enhancedview sla represented 37.1% of our 2013 net revenue.\\n\u00a0\\nprofitably
        grow and diversify our revenue beyond the enhancedview contract.\u00a0\u00a0we
        expect to continue to grow our revenue and reduce our revenue concentration
        on the enhancedview contract by attracting new customers and introducing new
        products to better meet all of our customers\u0092 needs.\\n\u00a0\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntable
        of contents\\n\u00a0\\ntoday, the u.s. government is our largest customer
        providing 58.4% of our 2013 net revenue. our predictive analytics software
        and expert services have allowed us to provide additional services beyond
        the enhancedview contract. we also serve international government customers
        in the areas of defense and intelligence and international civil agencies
        with imagery and related services.\u00a0 we have customers in our direct access
        program (\u0093dap\u0094) located in ten countries, which generated 16.5%
        of our 2013 net revenue.\u00a0 excluding our dap customers, our international
        defense and intelligence and international civil government customers totaled
        11.0% of our 2013 net revenue. additionally, we serve internet-based mapping
        and location-based services customers, which comprised 7.7% of our 2013 net
        revenue.\u00a0 we provide our mapping and location-based services customers
        with imagery and higher-value regional and global basemaps that enhance their
        products. finally, we serve a wide array of other commercial customers, which
        we refer to as industry verticals, comprised of industries such as oil and
        gas, mining, utilities, agriculture, retail, manufacturing, financial services,
        and non-government organizations with our imagery, information and insight
        services. this broad set of customers represented 6.4% of our 2013 net revenue.\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        will continue to invest in new offerings to enable our customers to gain new
        insights that will help them better support their business objectives.\u00a0
        we believe that our earth imagery, resolution, accuracy, high-scale image
        production capabilities and expert personnel establish us as a leader in the
        production and analysis of imagery. we believe that our imagelibrary is the
        largest, most up-to-date and comprehensive archive of high-resolution earth
        imagery commercially available, containing more than 4.5\u00a0billion square
        kilometers of imagery, an area the equivalent of 30 times the landmass of
        the earth, accumulated since 1999. given the scale of our imagery, we are
        able to offer information products derived from our imagery at scale, including
        a variety of higher value, web-based regional and global basemaps.\u00a0 we
        expect to continue to introduce new information products derived from imagery
        at scale that enable among other things, automated feature extraction, agriculture
        boundaries and crop health, land cover classification (e.g., minerals, trees)
        and seabed mapping.\u00a0 additionally, the large scale of our imagery and
        information enables us to provide analysis services, including predictive
        analytics, to discover patterns and correlations in data not possible to identify
        on a smaller scale.\u00a0 by continuing to address our customers\u0092 needs
        and integrate our offerings into their workflow, we expect to grow our customer
        base and revenue.\\n\u00a0\\noutperform our competition operationally and
        in customer satisfaction.\u00a0 we continue to advance our capabilities, product
        quality and customer experience enabling growth and margin expansion. we continue
        to optimize and develop our satellite constellation and ground terminal network
        in order to increase the capability of our constellation that is made available
        to the nga and our other customers. we currently have five in-orbit satellites
        and two satellites under construction. following the completion of construction
        of our two satellites, we intend to launch one of them, worldview-3, in the
        summer of 2014 and we intend to place the other, geoeye-2, in storage until
        such time as incremental capacity to support higher revenue growth or replacement
        for an existing satellite is required.\u00a0 additionally, we have made investments
        in our imagery production capabilities that enable us to serve higher quality
        and quantities of processed imagery via our web services infrastructure, including
        classified facilities for our u.s. government customers. we continue to improve
        our platform capabilities to make imagery and information within our imagelibrary
        searchable and easy to access.\u00a0 we also introduced a quality program
        that focuses on our products and customer experience on four dimensions, accuracy,
        currency, completeness and consistency, aimed at addressing the specific needs
        of each customer segment that we serve.\u00a0 additionally, we instituted
        a formal customer satisfaction program to measure and track our performance.\\n\u00a0\\nbehave

        of imagery from our constellation of five high-resolution satellites, as well
        as aerial imagery that we had acquired from a third party supplier. we also
        provide geospatial information and insight services in which we combine our
        earth imagery, analytic expertise, and innovative technology to deliver integrated
        solutions. we process our imagery to varying levels according to our customers\u0092
        specifications and deliver our products using the distribution method that
        best suits our customers\u0092 needs. customers can purchase satellite or
        aerial images that are archived in our imagelibrary, or place custom orders
        to task our satellites for a specific area of interest, or as a bundle of
        imaging and data for a region or type of location, such as cities, ports,
        harbors or airports.\\n\u00a0\\nsatellite imagery\\n\u00a0\\ncustomers specify

        ortho-rectified imagery with radiometric, geometric and topographic correction.
        radiometric correction enables images to appear uniformly illuminated with
        the appropriate level of brightness. geometric correction allows a user to
        identify the latitudinal, longitudinal and altitudinal location of any point
        in an image. topographic correction accounts for terrain and projects images
        onto the earth as they would be seen by the human eye. in addition, we provide
        mosaic imagery products. the mosaic process takes multiple imagery scenes,
        collected at different times and dates, and merges them into a single seamless
        imagery product;\\n\u00a0\\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

        two different viewpoints along the satellite orbit track that are produced
        as basic products, but can be viewed in stereo (\u00933d\u0094) using specialized
        software. stereo imagery products are used for the creation of digital elevation
        maps, for the more accurate creation of 3d maps and flight simulations; and\\n\u00a0\\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

        have one reportable segment in which we provide imagery and imagery information
        products and services to customers around the world. we sell our imagery and
        services to two groups of customers: u.s. government and diversified commercial.\u00a0
        u.s. government net revenue is sourced from multiple u.s. government agencies,
        primarily focused on defense and intelligence, with our largest customer being
        the nga.\u00a0 the nga serves as the primary u.s. government procurement agency
        for geospatial information and purchases imagery products and services on
        behalf of various agencies within the u.s. government, including defense,
        intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\u00a0 the u.s. government comprised
        58.4% of our total 2013 consolidated net revenue.\u00a0 diversified commercial
        net revenue is sourced from customers in our dap, location-based services
        (\u0093lbs\u0094), international civil government and from industry verticals.\u00a0
        in 2013, we generated 41.6% of our net revenue from diversified commercial

        august\u00a06, 2010, we entered into the enhancedview contract with nga. the
        enhancedview contract has a ten-year term, inclusive of nine one-year options
        exercisable by nga and is subject to congressional appropriations and the
        right of nga to terminate or suspend the contract at any time.\\n\u00a0\\nenhancedview
        service level agreement\\n\u00a0\\nthe enhancedview sla totals $2.8 billion
        over the term of the contract, payable as $250.0 million per year ($20.8 million
        monthly) for the first four contract years commencing september\u00a01, 2010,
        and $300.0 million per year ($25.0 million monthly) for the\\n\u00a0\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntable
        of contents\\n\u00a0\\nremaining six years of the contract beginning september\u00a01,
        2014. we are required to meet certain service level requirements related to
        the operational performance of the satellites comprising the worldview constellation
        and related ground systems. the nga has exercised the first three options
        under the enhancedview sla, collectively extending the enhancedview sla through
        august\u00a031, 2014.\u00a0 we believe it is nga\u0092s intention to exercise
        the remaining options, subject only to annual appropriation of funding and
        the federal budget process, which funding contains an inherent level of uncertainty
        in the current budget environment.\\n\u00a0\\nwe recognize net revenue for
        the enhancedview sla using a proportional performance method. under this method,
        net revenue is recognized based on the estimated amount of capacity made available
        to nga in any given period compared to the total estimated capacity to be
        provided over the life of the contract. as increasing levels of capacity are
        made available to nga, we recognize enhancedview sla revenue in direct proportion
        to the increased level of capacity made available. the contract requires us
        to increase the capacity made available to nga through the addition of our
        worldview-3 satellite (scheduled to launch in the summer of 2014) as well
        as the installation of seven additional remote ground terminals, the last
        of which was installed in july\u00a02012. we are currently operating all remote
        ground terminals required by the enhancedview sla. given the significant amount
        of constellation capacity that will be made available to nga once worldview-3
        becomes operational, we anticipate a material increase in net revenue once
        worldview-3 reaches full operational capability (\u0093foc\u0094). accordingly,
        once worldview-3 reaches foc we will begin to earn and recognize previously
        deferred revenue.\\n\u00a0\\nduring the first and second quarters of 2012,
        we and nga agreed to modifications of the enhancedview contract that included
        increasing the amount of capacity made available to nga and adjustments to
        the performance penalty (formerly \u0093holdback\u0094). the modifications
        did not result in a material change to the enhancedview sla accounting, and
        we continue to use the proportional performance method of net revenue recognition.\\n\u00a0\\neach
        monthly enhancedview sla payment is subject to a performance penalty ranging
        from 3% to 10% through february\u00a028, 2013 and 6% thereafter, depending
        upon the company\u0092s performance against pre-defined enhancedview sla performance
        criteria. if nga determines that not all of the enhancedview sla performance
        criteria were met in a given month, a performance penalty is assessed for
        that month. we retain the full monthly cash payment; however, the penalty
        amount will be applied to mutually agreeable future products and services,
        or to a pro-rated extension beyond the current contract period. accordingly,
        all penalty amounts will cause us to defer recognition of a corresponding
        net revenue amount until the performance penalty funds are consumed as described
        above. there was no penalty during the year ended december\u00a031, 2013.
        during the year ended december\u00a031, 2012, there was a $0.2 million penalty,
        or 0.08% of our annual contractual cash receipts, all of which was applied
        to other products and recognized as net revenue within the year.\u00a0 cumulatively
        over the life of the enhancedview contract, we have had total penalties of
        $0.4 million, or 0.05% of our total cash receipts under the contract, which
        was applied to other products and has been recognized to date.\\n\u00a0\\nthe
        nga has exercised the first three options under the enhancedview sla collectively
        extending the sla through august\u00a031, 2014.\\n\u00a0\\nenhancedview value
        added and other services\\n\u00a0\\nenhancedview also provided for up to approximately
        $750.0 million for value added products and services, infrastructure enhancements,
        and other services including the option for nga to require the company to
        lower the altitude of worldview-2 from its current altitude of 770 kilometers
        to an altitude of 496 kilometers. value added products and services enable
        us to meet nga\u0092s more advanced imagery requirements using its production
        and dissemination capabilities.\u00a0 in 2013, we recognized $70.6 million
        in revenue for value-added products and services and a cumulative total of
        $109.6 million since the inception of the enhancedview contract.\\n\u00a0\\ndigitalglobe

        decision making.\u00a0 we work with many defense and intelligence customers
        to provide embedded analytic services, foundational geospatial data, and unique
        technology solutions that support military intelligence missions around the
        globe.\u00a0 while we primarily support u.s. government customers, many of
        our capabilities also support intelligence requirements from international
        governments, non-government organizations and commercial customers.\\n\u00a0\\nnextview\\n\u00a0\\nin
        connection with our nextview agreement with nga (which was entered into in
        september\u00a02003 and was the predecessor to our current enhancedview contract)
        we received $266.0\u00a0million from nga to offset the construction costs
        of worldview-1, which was recorded as deferred revenue when received. when

        earn revenue from sales of the dap facility hardware and software, as well
        as service fees to access our satellite constellation. the revenue to access
        our satellite constellation is recognized over time based on minutes of actual
        usage. the revenue and costs associated with the sales of a dap facility are
        deferred until we commission into operation the ground terminal and can provide
        contractually specified access to our operational satellites. the revenue
        and costs are then recognized ratably over the customer relationship period,
        which is based on the estimated useful life of the satellite being accessed,
        except when deferred contract costs are in excess of deferred revenue, in
        which case the excess costs are recognized over the initial contract period.
        if more than one satellite is used, the satellite with the longest remaining
        useful life is used as the basis for the amortization of revenue. as of december\u00a031,
        2013, we had dap agreements in ten countries.\u00a0 in 2013, we generated
        $100.8\u00a0million in net revenue from our currently operational dap customers

        insurance covering risks associated with our satellite operations including
        the partial or total impairment of the functional capacity of the satellite.
        we insure certain satellites in our constellation to the extent that insurance
        is available at acceptable premiums. we do not insure the ikonos satellite
        and in the third quarter of 2013 we stopped insurance coverage for our quickbird
        satellite.\u00a0 given the late stage of their useful lives, we do not intend

        satellites under construction are insured through the third-parties that are
        providing the construction services. when the geoeye-2 satellite is placed
        into storage at the third party construction site, the insurance will be included
        in the storage and maintenance fees we receive from the vendor, and will be
        expensed as incurred.\u00a0 as of december\u00a031, 2013, we maintained the

        2013, we owned or leased 13 operational remote ground terminals (\u0093rgt\u0094)
        located throughout the world. each ground terminal is strategically placed
        to optimize contact with our satellites on their orbital paths.\u00a0 each
        of our satellites orbits the earth approximately 15 times per day, communicating
        with one or more of our ground terminals. our image processing facility at
        our longmont, colorado headquarters houses the hardware and software systems
        and personnel required to operate and control our satellites as well as process,
        store and distribute our imagery. operational control of our satellites, and
        all data related processing, storing and distribution, are primarily managed
        from our facility in longmont, colorado.\\n\u00a0\\nintellectual property\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        rely on licenses of certain intellectual property to conduct our business
        operations. specifically, we license certain proprietary rights from third

        and technologies corp., harris technical services corporation, macdonald dettwiler
        and associates ltd., orbit logic and the university of new brunswick to enable
        us to operate our satellites, ground terminals, collection systems and other
        various components of our systems. in addition, we actively pursue internal
        development of intellectual property. we have registered, and applied for
        the registration of, u.s. and international trademarks, service marks, domain
        names, and copyrights. additionally, we have filed u.s. and international
        patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology and processes.\\n\u00a0\\nregulation\\n\u00a0\\noperations\\n\u00a0\\nthe
        satellite operations portion of our business is highly regulated. the department
        of commerce (\u0093doc\u0094), pursuant to the national and commercial space
        programs act of 2010 (successor legislation to the 1992 land remote sensing
        policy act, as amended), has the primary regulatory authority over our industry.
        the doc delegated responsibility for satellite remote sensing operations to
        noaa. each of our satellites is required to be individually licensed for operation
        by noaa. we currently have licenses for our quickbird, worldview-1, worldview-2,
        worldview-3,\u00a0ikonos, geoeye-1 and geoeye-2 satellites, which we refer
        to as the noaa licenses. our noaa licenses require us to obtain prior approval
        from noaa for any significant and substantial foreign agreements and generally
        require us to operate our satellite system in a manner that is consistent
        with u.s. national security and foreign policy objectives. our noaa license
        for worldview-2 requires that all data be resampled to a ground resolution
        of 0.50 meter black and white and 2.0 meter multispectral before it may be
        commercially distributed to customers other than the u.s. government or entities
        specifically approved by the u.s. government. in addition, the noaa licenses
        allow the u.s. government to suspend our imaging activities in certain cases,
        if deemed necessary, for national security reasons. the noaa licenses are
        valid for the operational life of the satellites, provided that we comply
        the licensing terms.\\n\u00a0\\nthe launch of our satellites and the communication
        links, both uplink and downlink, are regulated by the u.s. federal communications
        commission (\u0093fcc\u0094). fcc licenses must be obtained for each individual
        satellite. the fcc is the governmental agency with primary authority in the
        united states over the commercial use of the satellite frequency spectrum.
        we currently have the requisite licensing authority from the fcc to operate
        our quickbird, worldview-1,worldview-2,\u00a0ikonos and geoeye-1 satellites.
        the fcc has also granted licenses to operate ground terminals for our satellites.
        the fcc\u0092s rules\u00a0and regulations and terms of our licenses require
        that we comply with various operating conditions and requirements. failure
        to comply with these or other conditions or requirements could lead to sanctions,
        up to and including revocation, cancellation or non-renewal of our licenses.
        in addition to the fcc\u0092s requirements, our satellites must undergo the
        frequency coordination and registration process of the international telecommunications
        union (\u0093itu\u0094).\\n\u00a0\\nsales\\n\u00a0\\nsatellite imagery does
        not require an export license in order to be sold internationally. our ability
        to sell certain imagery products and value added services may be subject to

        equipment and related technology necessary to allow access to the satellites
        are controlled under the international traffic in arms regulations (\u0093itar\u0094).
        the approval process for these sales usually takes approximately two to three
        months, and there is no obligation on the part of either noaa or the dos to
        approve any transaction. in addition to required u.s. government approvals,
        the export of equipment from canada by our dap equipment supplier, macdonald
        dettwiler\u00a0& associated ltd., is subject to canadian export license requirements.
        our dap customers may also be required to obtain additional approvals from
        the government of the country in which the ground terminal is to be operated.\\n\u00a0\\nownership\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        are obligated under our noaa licenses to monitor and report increases in foreign
        ownership of common stock of the company and any agreement for ownership of
        20% or greater of our common stock is subject to noaa approval. we are also
        required to report certain common stock foreign ownership levels to the defense
        security service and to comply with certain rules\u00a0and regulations to
        mitigate foreign influence as part of maintaining our facility security clearances.
        our facility security clearance allows us to perform work on u.s. government
        classified contracts. a transfer to foreign ownership also could trigger other
        requirements including filings with, and review by, the committee on foreign
        investment in the united states pursuant to the exon-florio provision. depending
        on the country of origin and identity of foreign owners, other restrictions
        and requirements may also arise.\\n\u00a0\\nbusiness seasonality\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        have historically experienced higher net revenues in the second half of the

        and results of operations.\\n\u00a0\\nour contracts with u.s. government agencies
        are subject to risks of termination or reduction in scope due to changes in
        u.s. government policies, priorities or funding level commitments to various
        agencies. under the enhancedview sla, we are obligated to make a portion of
        the image tasking capacity of the worldview constellation available to nga,
        including specified priority access rights. to support requirements under
        the enhancedview contract, we began constructing our worldview-3 satellite
        in september\u00a02010 and we are investing in infrastructure to integrate
        certain of our operations more closely with nga.\u00a0 beginning september\u00a01,
        2013, nga has the option to require us to lower the altitude of worldview-2
        from its current altitude of 770 kilometers to an altitude of 496 kilometers,
        subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. the lowering of the
        orbital altitude could result in a decrease in the amount of square kilometers
        collected by worldview-2. while we believe the decrease in collection capability
        would be offset by improved data capture capabilities on the ground resulting
        from the expansion of our ground terminal network, there can be no assurance
        that our current collection capability will be maintained. our ability to
        service other customers could be negatively impacted if we are unable to maintain
        our current collection capacity. in addition, any inability on our part to
        meet the performance requirements of the enhancedview contract could result
        in a breach of our contract with nga. a breach of our contract with nga or
        reduction in service to our other clients could have a material adverse effect
        on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\u00a0\\nnga
        may also terminate or suspend our contracts, including the enhancedview contract,
        at any time with or without cause. although our nga contracts generally involve
        fixed annual minimum commitments, such commitments are subject to annual congressional
        appropriations and the federal budget process, and as a result, nga may not
        continue to fund these contracts at current or anticipated levels. in addition,
        the sequestration process under the budget control act of 2011 (pl 112-25)
        could have an adverse impact on the timing and amount of appropriations available
        for defense programs, including enhancedview. under the terms of the budget
        control act, discretionary spending is capped, and any breach of the caps
        would result in automatic, across-the-board spending cuts, known as sequestration.
        the budget control act assumed that spending cap recommendations would be
        recommended to congress by the joint select committee on deficit reduction.
        this committee failed to come to agreement, and accordingly sequestration
        was implemented during 2013. sequestration did not have a material effect
        on our financial position or results of operations during 2013, however, future
        reductions in the current enhancedview program or other current or future
        business with the department of defense resulting from sequestration could
        have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
        of operations.\\n\u00a0\\nany program delays encountered in implementing the
        infrastructure enhancements required to support the enhancedview contract,
        or in the construction, launch and operational commissioning of our worldview-3
        satellite may affect our ability to meet our obligations under the enhancedview
        contract resulting in a reduction of scope or termination of the contract,
        and may otherwise require us to increase our reliance on our existing satellites
        to meet our business needs, which could have a material adverse effect on
        our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\u00a0\\nto

        and are in the process of building our worldview-3 satellite. we currently
        expect to launch worldview-3 in the summer of 2014 and commission the satellite
        approximately 90 days after launch.\u00a0 the manufacturing, testing and launch
        of satellites involves complex processes and technology. we rely on third
        party contractors for the manufacturing, testing and launch of our satellites,
        including worldview-3. many factors, including, but not limited to, availability
        of parts, subcontractor and supplier delays and anomalies discovered during
        testing, may result in significant delays to the worldview-3 program. in addition,
        while we have contracted with lockheed martin commercial launch services for
        the launch of worldview-3 in the summer of 2014, launch windows and specific
        dates, once scheduled, are subject to change and may be materially delayed
        for reasons beyond our control, including intervening launch failures of other
        satellites, reduced availability of launch facilities and support crew, weather
        and preemption by certain government launches. after launch, the satellite
        must be calibrated and tested to confirm operational capability, a commissioning
        process that typically takes several months. the satellite may not pass the
        operational commissioning tests or may not otherwise operate as required.
        for example, satellites may experience technical difficulties communicating
        with the ground terminals or collecting imagery in the same quality or volume
        that was intended. the failure to construct and launch worldview-3 on time
        or to achieve operational commissioning on time or at all could affect our\\n\u00a0\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntable

        we compete against aerial providers of high-resolution imagery, whose offerings
        provide certain benefits over satellite-based imagery, including better resolution
        and accuracy. the value of our imagery may also be diluted by earth imagery
        that is available free of charge.\\n\u00a0\\nthe u.s. government and foreign
        governments also may develop, construct, launch and operate their own imagery
        satellites, which could reduce their need to rely on commercial suppliers.
        in addition, such governments could sell or provide free of charge earth imagery
        from their satellites in the commercial market and thereby compete with our
        imagery products and services. also, governments may at times make our imagery
        freely available for humanitarian purposes, which could impair our revenue
        growth with non-governmental organizations.\u00a0 these governments could

        or the continued growth of low-cost imaging satellites, could negatively affect
        our marketing efforts. more importantly, if competitors develop and launch
        satellites or other imagery content sources with more advanced capabilities
        and technologies than ours, or offer services at lower prices than ours, our

        significantly since we began offering commercial services in 2001. although
        we have historically been able to obtain insurance coverage for our in-orbit
        satellites, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future.
        although we intend to maintain insurance for our operating satellites, any
        determination we make as to whether to obtain insurance coverage will depend
        on a variety of factors, including the availability of insurance in the market,
        the cost of available insurance and the redundancy of our operating satellites.
        insurance market conditions or factors outside our control at the time we
        are in the market for the required insurance, such as failure of a satellite
        using similar components, could cause premiums to be significantly higher
        than current estimates and could reduce amounts of available coverage. higher
        premiums on insurance policies will increase our costs and consequently reduce
        our operating income by the amount of such increased premiums. if the terms
        of in-orbit insurance policies become less favorable than those currently
        available, there may be limits on the amount of coverage that we can obtain
        or we may not be able to obtain insurance at all. even if obtained, our in-orbit
        operations insurance will not cover any loss in net revenue incurred as a
        result of a partial or total satellite loss.\\n\u00a0\\nwe are highly dependent
        upon our imagelibrary and our failure or inability to protect and maintain
        the earth imagery content stored in our imagelibrary could have a material

        content and our imagelibrary against damage that may be caused by fire and
        other natural disasters, power failures, telecommunications failures, terrorist
        attacks, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses, equipment malfunction or
        inadequacy, firewall breach or other events. the satellite imagery content
        we collect is downloaded directly to our facilities and then stored in our
        imagelibrary for sale to customers. our aerial imagery is collected and processed
        by our aerial suppliers and then delivered to us to be uploaded to our imagelibrary.
        we back up our imagery and permanently store it with a third party data storage
        provider. notwithstanding precautions we have taken to protect our imagelibrary,
        there can be no assurance that a natural disaster or other event would not
        result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide access to or
        deliver imagery from our imagelibrary to our clients. the temporary or permanent
        loss or disruption of access to our imagelibrary could impair our ability
        to supply current and future customers with imagery content, have a negative
        impact on our net revenue and cause harm to our reputation. any impairment
        in our ability to supply our customers with imagery content could affect our
        ability to retain or attract customers, which would have a material adverse
        effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\u00a0\\nthe

        success depends on existing markets accepting our imagery products and services
        and our ability to develop new markets. our business plan is based on the
        assumption that we will generate significant future net revenue from sales
        of imagery products and services produced from our satellites and our other
        imagery content sources. the commercial sale of high-resolution earth imagery
        and related products and services is a relatively new industry. consequently,
        it is difficult to predict the ultimate size of the markets and the acceptance
        by the markets of our products and services. our business strategy and projections
        rely on a number of assumptions, some or all of which may be incorrect. actual
        markets could vary materially from the potential markets that we have identified.\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        cannot accurately predict whether our products and services will achieve significant
        market acceptance or whether there will be a market for our products and services
        on terms we find acceptable. market acceptance of our commercial high-resolution
        earth imagery and related products and services depends on a number of factors,
        including the quality, scope, timeliness, sophistication, price and the availability
        of substitute products and services. lack of significant market acceptance
        of our offerings, or other products and services that utilize our products
        and services, delays in acceptance, failure of certain markets to develop
        or our need to make significant investments to achieve acceptance by the market

        business plan depends in large part on the success of our subsidiary, aireon
        llc, which is our primary hosted payload customer.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nin june
        2012, we announced our plans to host a payload being developed by our subsidiary,
        aireon llc, as our primary hosted payload. we currently expect to rely on
        the cash flows generated from this hosted-payload arrangement with aireon
        to satisfy a portion of our capital requirements through the development and
        deployment of iridium next. aireon\u2019s payload will be a satellite-based
        ads-b system for global air traffic monitoring, and aireon\u2019s success
        will depend on its ability to successfully develop and manufacture this system.
        deploying an ads-b system on satellites is a new and unproven method for providing
        this service and will require significant technological development. aireon
        will need to complete the development and manufacture of its ads-b payloads
        in time to include them on our iridium next satellites, which we expect to
        begin launching in 2015. in addition, aireon\u2019s success will depend on
        the development of the market for a space-based ads-b service among ansps,
        such as the u.s. federal aviation administration. \\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\naireon
        will itself require significant additional capital to complete the successful
        development, deployment and operation of its system. the aireon llc agreement
        provides for the purchase by nav canada satellite and three other ansp investors
        of additional membership interests in multiple tranches through late 2017
        for an aggregate investment of up to $270 million. each tranche, however,
        is subject to the satisfaction of various operational, commercial, regulatory
        and financial conditions, some of which will be out of our control, and the
        investors have significant discretion in the determination of whether those
        conditions have been met. \\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nthe management of aireon is not
        entirely within our control given the significant veto rights and other protective
        provisions provided to nav canada and the other investors, and for accounting
        purposes we treat aireon as a subsidiary that we do not control. as a result,
        we may not be able to cause aireon to take actions that we believe are necessary
        for its ultimate success.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nif aireon is not successful and
        fails to pay its hosting costs, our ability to pursue our business plan would
        be compromised unless we were able to replace those amounts with capital from
        other sources.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe expect to need additional capital to design,
        build and launch iridium next and related ground infrastructure, products
        and services, and to pursue additional growth opportunities. if we fail to
        maintain access to sufficient capital, we will not be able to successfully
        implement our business plan.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nour business plan calls for
        the development of iridium next, the development of new product and service
        offerings, upgrades to our current services, hardware and software upgrades
        to maintain our ground infrastructure and upgrades to our business systems.
        we estimate the costs associated with the design, build and launch of iridium
        next and related ground infrastructure upgrades through 2017 to be approximately
        $3 billion. our funding plan for these costs includes the funds available
        under our $1.8 billion loan facility, which were refer to in this report as
        the credit facility, together with cash on hand, internally generated cash
        flows, including potential cash flows from hosted payloads and iridium prime,
        and the proceeds from capital raises that we expect to be required in connection
        with our planned amendment of the credit facility.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n
        \\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe expect to need modifications
        to the credit facility for some financial covenants with measurement dates
        beyond the next twelve months, and there can be no assurance that the lenders
        will agree to such modifications. we also expect that we will be required
        to raise additional capital as a condition to such modifications, which may
        not be available on favorable terms, or at all. in addition, our ongoing ability
        to make draws under the credit facility will depend upon our satisfaction
        of those and other borrowing conditions from time to time, some of which will
        be outside of our control. for more information, see \u201cmanagement\u2019s

        generated cash flows will meet our current expectations, or that we will not
        encounter increased costs. for example, aireon may be unable to pay its hosting
        costs, and the market for iridium prime may not develop as we expect. if internally
        generated cash flows, including potential cash from hosted payload arrangements
        or iridium prime, are less than we expect, we might need to finance the remaining
        cost of iridium next by raising additional debt or equity financing. in addition,
        we may need additional capital to design and launch new products and services
        on iridium next. such additional financing may not be available on favorable
        terms, or at all.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nif we are unable to raise additional capital
        for one or more of these needs, our ability to maintain our network, design,
        build and launch iridium next and related ground infrastructure, develop new
        products and services and pursue additional growth opportunities will be impaired,
        which would significantly limit the development of our business and impair
        our ability to provide a commercially acceptable level of service. we may
        experience overall liquidity levels lower than our recent liquidity levels.
        inadequate liquidity could compromise our ability to pursue our business plans
        and growth opportunities and make borrowings under the credit facility, delay
        the ultimate deployment of iridium next or otherwise impair our business and

        if we are unable to effectively deploy iridium next for any reason, whether
        as a result of insufficient funds, manufacturing or launch delays, launch
        failures, in-orbit satellite failures, inability to achieve or maintain orbital
        placement, failure of the satellites to perform as expected, interference

        problems with our new constellation once deployed, we would likely lose customers
        and business opportunities to our competitors, resulting in a potentially
        material decline in revenue and profitability and the inability to service
        our debt.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\niridium next may not be completed on time, and
        the costs associated with it may be greater than expected.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe
        estimate that the costs associated with the design, build and launch of iridium
        next and related ground infrastructure upgrades through 2017 will be approximately
        $3 billion, although our actual costs could substantially exceed this estimate.
        we may not complete iridium next and related ground infrastructure on time,
        on budget or at all. we expect to delay our first launch, previously scheduled
        for the first quarter of 2015, to the second quarter of 2015 because of delays
        in software development by our satellite manufacturer. the design, manufacture
        and launch of satellite systems are highly complex and historically have been

        addition, there can be no assurance the ground infrastructure needed to complete
        iridium next will be completed on time, on budget or at all. if the design,
        manufacture and deployment of iridium next costs more or takes longer than
        we anticipate, our ability to continue to develop iridium next and related
        ground infrastructure could be compromised.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nloss of any iridium
        next satellite during launch could delay or impair our ability to offer our
        services, and launch insurance, to the extent available, will not fully cover
        this risk.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nthe launch of our iridium next satellites will
        be subject to the inherent risk of launch failures, which could result in
        the loss or destruction of one or more satellites. we have entered into our
        launch services agreement with spacex, pursuant to which spacex will provide
        launch services to us in connection with our deployment of iridium next.\u00a0the
        spacex agreement contemplates seven launches of ten satellites each on spacex\u2019s
        falcon 9 launch vehicle over a two-year period. spacex has a limited operating
        history and limited financial resources, and\u00a0the falcon 9 has a limited
        launch history, which could expose us to delay, greater risk of launch failure
        or the need to utilize an alternate launch services provider, which could
        substantially increase our launch costs. we have also entered into a launch
        services agreement with kosmotras pursuant to which kosmotras will provide
        supplemental or alternative launch services for iridium next, pursuant to
        which we have exercised an option to have kosmotras launch the first two iridium
        next satellites. the use of kosmotras to replace one or more of the contemplated
        spacex launches would increase our launch costs.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n
        \\n\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe are required under
        the terms of the credit facility to insure a portion of the launch of our
        iridium next satellites, and we expect to self-insure the remaining portion.
        launch insurance currently costs approximately 4% to 11% of the insured value
        of the satellites launched, including launch costs, but costs may vary depending
        on market conditions and the safety record of the launch vehicle. in addition,
        we expect any launch insurance policies that we obtain to include specified
        exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations. typically, these
        insurance policies contain exclusions customary in the industry for damage
        arising from acts of war, lasers and other similar potential risks. if launch
        insurance rates were to rise substantially, our future launch costs could
        increase. it is also possible that insurance could become unavailable or prohibitively
        expensive, either generally or for a specific launch vehicle, or that new
        insurance could be subject to broader exclusions on coverage or limitations
        on losses, in which event we would bear the risk of launch failures. even
        if a lost satellite is fully insured, acquiring a replacement satellite may
        be difficult and time-consuming and could delay the deployment of iridium
        next. furthermore, launch insurance does not cover lost revenue.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nour
        satellites have a limited life and may fail prematurely, which would cause
        our network to be compromised and materially and adversely affect our business,
        prospects and profitability.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nsince we introduced commercial
        services in 2001, we have experienced ten satellite losses, most recently
        in january 2014. nine of our satellites have failed in orbit, which has resulted
        in either the complete loss of the affected satellites or the loss of the
        ability of the satellite to carry traffic on the network, and one satellite
        was lost as a result of a collision with a non-operational russian satellite.
        also, our satellites have already exceeded their original design lives. while
        actual useful life typically exceeds original design life, the useful lives
        of our satellites may be shorter than we expect, and additional satellites
        may fail or collide with space debris or other satellites in the future. although
        to date we have had an in-orbit spare available to replace each lost satellite,
        we can provide no assurance that our in-orbit spare satellites will be sufficient
        to replace all future lost satellites, that we will be able to replace them
        in a timely manner, or that the spare satellite will provide the same level
        of performance as the lost satellite. as a result, while we expect our current
        constellation to provide a commercially acceptable level of service through
        the transition to iridium next, we cannot guarantee it will be able to do
        so. in-orbit failure may result from various causes, including component failure,
        loss of power or fuel, inability to control positioning of the satellite,
        solar or other astronomical events, including solar radiation and flares,
        and space debris. other factors that could affect the useful lives of our
        satellites include the quality of construction, gradual degradation of solar
        panels and the durability of components. radiation-induced failure of satellite
        components may result in damage to or loss of a satellite before the end of
        its expected life. as our constellation has aged, some of our satellites have
        experienced individual component failures affecting their coverage or transmission
        capacity, and other satellites may experience such failures in the future,
        which could adversely affect the reliability of their service or result in
        total failure of the satellite. as a result, fewer than 66 of our current
        in-orbit satellites are fully functioning at any time. although we do not
        incur any direct cash costs related to the failure of a satellite, if a satellite
        fails, we record an impairment charge in our statement of operations to reduce
        the remaining net book value of that satellite to zero, and any such impairment
        charges could significantly depress our net income for the period in which
        the failure occurs.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nfrom time to time, we are advised by
        our customers and end users of temporary intermittent losses of signal cutting
        off calls in progress, preventing completions of calls when made or disrupting
        the transmission of data. if the magnitude or frequency of such problems increase
        and we are no longer able to provide a commercially acceptable level of service,
        our business and financial results and our reputation would be hurt and our
        ability to pursue our business plan would be compromised.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe
        may be required in the future to make further changes to our constellation
        to maintain or improve its performance. any such changes may require prior
        fcc approval, and the fcc may subject the approval to other conditions that
        could be unfavorable to our business. in addition, from time to time we may
        reposition our satellites within the constellation in order to optimize our
        service, which could result in degraded service during the repositioning period.
        although we have some ability to remedy some types of problems affecting the
        performance of our satellites remotely from the ground, the physical repair
        of our satellites in space is not feasible.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nour agreements

        portion of our revenue, are subject to termination.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nthe u.s.

        of our services to the u.s. government pursuant to our gmss and emss contracts.
        we entered into new versions of these contracts in september and october 2013,
        respectively. the new gmss contract provides for a one-year base term and
        up to four additional one-year options exercisable at the election of the
        u.s. government, and the new emss contract provides for a five-year term.
        the u.s. government may terminate these agreements, in whole or in part, at
        any time for its convenience. if the u.s. government terminates either of
        the agreements or decides not to exercise options under the gmss agreement,
        we would lose a significant portion of our revenue.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n

        information for the design, manufacture and sale of our devices. this intellectual
        property is essential to our ability to continue to operate our constellation
        and sell our services, handsets and data devices. in addition, we are dependent
        on third parties to develop enhancements to our current products and services
        even in circumstances where we own the intellectual property. if any third-party
        owner of such intellectual property were to terminate any license agreement
        with us or cease to support and service this technology or perform development
        on our behalf, or if we are unable to renew such licenses on commercially
        reasonable terms or at all, it may be difficult, more expensive or impossible
        to obtain such services from alternative vendors. any substitute technology
        may also be costly to develop and integrate, or could have lower quality or
        performance standards, which would adversely affect the quality of our products
        and services. in connection with the design, manufacture and operation of
        iridium next and related ground infrastructure and the development of new

        or could perform at reduced levels of service because of technological malfunctions
        or deficiencies or events outside of our control which would seriously harm
        our business and reputation.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nour products and services are
        subject to the risks inherent in a large-scale, complex telecommunications
        system employing advanced technology. any disruption to our satellites, services,
        information systems or telecommunications infrastructure could result in the
        inability of our customers to receive our services for an indeterminate period
        of time. these customers include government agencies conducting mission-critical
        work throughout the world, as well as consumers and businesses located in
        remote areas of the world and operating under harsh environmental conditions
        where traditional telecommunications services may not be readily available.
        any disruption to our services or extended periods of reduced levels of service
        could cause us to lose customers or revenue, result in delays or cancellations
        of future implementations of our products and services, result in failure
        to attract customers or result in litigation, customer service or repair work
        that would involve substantial costs and distract management from operating
        our business. the failure of any of the diverse elements of our system, including
        our satellites, our commercial gateway, or our satellite network operations
        center, to function as required could render our system unable to perform
        at the quality and capacity levels required for success. any system failures,
        repeated product failures or shortened product life or extended reduced levels
        of service could reduce our sales, increase costs or result in warranty or
        liability claims or litigation, cause us to extend our warranty period and
        seriously harm our business.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nas our product portfolio expands,
        our failure to manage growth effectively could impede our ability to execute
        our business plan, and we may experience increased costs or disruption in
        our operations.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe currently face a variety of challenges,
        including maintaining the infrastructure and systems necessary for us to operate
        as a public company and managing the growth of our business. as our product
        portfolio continues to expand, the responsibilities of our management team
        and other company resources also grow. consequently, we may further strain
        our management and other company resources with the increased complexities
        and administrative burdens associated with a larger, more complex product
        portfolio. for example, we have in the past experienced quality issues in
        connection with the introduction of new products and services, and we may
        experience such issues in the future. our failure to meet these challenges
        as a result of insufficient management or other resources could significantly
        impede our ability to execute our business plan. to properly manage our growth,
        we may need to hire and retain additional personnel, upgrade our existing
        operational management and financial and reporting systems, and improve our
        business processes and controls. failure to effectively manage the expansion
        of our product portfolio in a cost-effective manner could result in declines
        in product and service quality and customer satisfaction, increased costs
        or disruption of our operations.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nas we and our distributors
        expand our offerings to include more consumer-oriented devices, we are more
        likely to be subject to product liability claims, recalls or litigation, which
        could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nthrough
        our network of distributors, we offer several products and services aimed
        at individual consumers, and we and our distributors continue to introduce
        more such products and services. these products and services, such as satellite
        handsets, personal locator devices and location-based services, may be used
        in isolated and dangerous locations, including emergency response situations,
        and users who suffer property damage, personal injury or death while using
        the product or service may seek to assert claims or bring lawsuits against
        us. we seek to limit our exposure to such claims through appropriate disclosures,
        indemnification provisions and disclaimers, but these steps may not be effective.
        we also maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance may not cover
        any particular claim or litigation, or the amount of insurance may be inadequate
        to cover the claims brought against us. product liability insurance could
        become more expensive and difficult to maintain and might not be available
        on acceptable terms or at all. in addition, it is possible that our products
        would become the subject of a product recall as a result of a product defect.
        we do not maintain recall insurance, so any recall could have a significant
        effect on our financial results. in addition to the direct expenses of product
        liability claims, recalls and litigation, a claim, recall or litigation might
        cause us adverse publicity, which could harm our reputation and compromise
        our ability to sell our products in the future.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n

        transmit, and in some cases store, end user data, including personal information.
        in jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly
        subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers\u2019
        privacy and security. the interpretation of privacy and data protection laws
        and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure
        of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving. these laws
        may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country
        and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.
        complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to
        incur additional costs and change our business practices. because our services
        are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions
        may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have
        no local entity, employees or infrastructure. we could be forced to incur
        significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services
        or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new
        or expanded regulations.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nin addition, if end users allege
        that their personal information is not collected, stored, transmitted, used
        or disclosed appropriately or in accordance with our privacy policies or applicable
        laws, we could have liability to them, including claims and litigation resulting
        from such allegations. any failure on our part to protect end users\u2019
        privacy and data could result in a loss of user confidence, hurt our reputation
        and ultimately result in the loss of users.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nour satellites
        may collide with space debris or another spacecraft, which could adversely
        affect the performance of our constellation.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nin february\u00a02009,
        we lost an operational satellite as a result of a collision with a non-operational
        russian satellite. although we have some ability to actively maneuver our
        satellites to avoid potential collisions with space debris or other spacecraft,
        this ability is limited by, among other factors, uncertainties and inaccuracies
        in the projected orbit location of and predicted conjunctions with debris
        objects tracked and cataloged by the u.s. government. additionally, some space
        debris is too small to be tracked and therefore its orbital location is completely
        unknown; nevertheless, this debris is still large enough to potentially cause
        severe damage or a failure of our satellites should a collision occur. if
        our constellation experiences additional satellite collisions with space debris
        or other spacecraft, our service could be impaired.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nthe space
        debris created by the february 2009 satellite collision may cause damage to
        other spacecraft positioned in a similar orbital altitude.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nthe
        collision of one of our satellites with a non-operational russian satellite
        created a space debris field concentrated in the orbital altitude where the
        collision occurred, and thus increased the risk of space debris damaging or
        interfering with the operation of our satellites, which travel in this orbital
        altitude, as well as satellites owned by third parties, such as u.s. or foreign
        governments or agencies and other satellite operators. although there are
        tools used by us and providers of tracking services, such as the u.s. joint
        space operations center, to detect, track and identify space debris, we or
        third parties may not be able to maneuver the satellites away from such debris
        in a timely manner. any such collision could potentially expose us to significant
        losses and liability if we were found to be at fault.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nif
        we experience operational disruptions with respect to our commercial gateway
        or operations center, we may not be able to provide service to our customers.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nour
        commercial satellite network traffic is supported by a primary ground station
        gateway in tempe, arizona. in addition, we operate our satellite constellation
        from our satellite network operations center in leesburg, virginia. currently,
        we do not have a backup facility for our gateway, and we would not be able
        to immediately implement our backup to the virginia operations center if that
        facility experienced a catastrophic failure. both facilities are subject to
        the risk of significant malfunctions or catastrophic loss due to unanticipated
        events and would be difficult to replace or repair and could require substantial
        lead-time to do so. material changes in the operation of these facilities
        may be subject to prior fcc approval, and the fcc might not give such approval
        or may subject the approval to other conditions that could be unfavorable
        to our business. our gateway and operations center may also experience service
        shutdowns or periods of reduced service in the future as a result of equipment
        failure, delays in deliveries or regulatory issues. any such failure would
        impede our ability to provide service to our customers. \\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe
        do not maintain in-orbit insurance covering our losses from satellite failures
        or other operational problems affecting our constellation.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe
        do not maintain in-orbit insurance covering losses that might arise as a result
        of a satellite failure or other operational problems affecting our constellation.
        the terms of the credit facility, however, require us to obtain and maintain
        such insurance for the iridium next satellites for a period of 12 months after
        launch. we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms, or
        at all. if we are not able to obtain in-orbit insurance, we may be unable
        to obtain a waiver, which would trigger an event of default under the credit
        facility and would likely accelerate repayment of all outstanding borrowings.
        even if we obtain in-orbit insurance in the future, the coverage may not be
        sufficient to compensate us for satellite failures and other operational problems
        affecting our satellites, as it may either contain large deductible amounts
        or provide reimbursement only after a specified number of satellite failures.
        as a result, a failure of one or more of our satellites or the occurrence
        of equipment failures and other related problems could constitute an uninsured
        loss and could harm our financial condition.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n

        affected by current global economic conditions.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nour operations
        and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. uncertainty
        about current global economic conditions poses a risk as individual consumers,
        businesses and governments may postpone spending in response to tighter credit,
        negative financial news, declines in income or asset values or budgetary constraints.
        reduced demand would cause a decline in our revenue and make it more difficult
        for us to operate profitably, potentially compromising our ability to pursue
        our business plan. while we expect the number of our subscribers and revenue
        to continue to grow, we expect the future growth rate will be slower than
        our historical growth and may not continue in every quarter of every year.
        we expect our future growth rate will be affected by the sluggish global economy,
        increased competition, maturation of the satellite communications industry
        and the difficulty in sustaining high growth rates as we increase in size.
        any substantial appreciation of the u.s. dollar may also negatively affect
        our growth by increasing the cost of our products and services in foreign
        countries.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nif we fail to maintain proper and effective internal
        controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely
        basis could be impaired.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe are subject to the reporting
        requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, the sarbanes-oxley act
        of 2002, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of
        2010 and the rules and regulations of the u.s. securities and exchange commission,
        or the sec, and the nasdaq stock market, or nasdaq. the sarbanes-oxley act
        requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls
        and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. we perform
        system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial
        reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal
        controls over financial reporting in our annual reports on form 10-k, as required
        by section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act. if we are not able to comply with
        the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act in a timely manner,
        or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we
        may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we
        may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective.
        if that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we
        could be subject to sanctions or investigations by nasdaq, the sec or other
        regulatory authorities.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nmaintaining effective internal controls
        over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial
        statements. in connection with the preparation of our quarterly report for
        the three months ended september 30, 2012, management discovered an error
        caused by a previously existing material weakness in internal controls over
        financial reporting relating to accounting for income taxes. this material
        weakness led to the need for the restatement of our financial statements for
        the years ended december 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and for the quarters ended
        december 31, 2009 through december 31, 2011.\u00a0if we fail to maintain effective
        controls over financial reporting in the future, it could result in a material
        misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected
        on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose
        confidence in our financial statements.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe could lose market
        share and revenue as a result of increasing competition from companies in
        the wireless communications industry, including cellular and other satellite
        operators, and from the extension of land-based communications services.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe
        face intense competition in all of our markets, which could result in a loss
        of customers and lower revenue and make it more difficult for us to enter
        new markets. we compete primarily on the basis of coverage, quality, portability
        and pricing of services and products.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nthe provision of satellite-based
        services and products is subject to downward price pressure when capacity
        exceeds demand or as a result of aggressive discounting by some operators
        under financial pressure to expand their respective market share. in addition,
        we may face competition from new competitors, new technologies or new equipment.
        for example, we may face competition for our land-based services in the united
        states from incipient ancillary terrestrial component, or atc, service providers
        who are currently raising capital and designing a satellite operating business
        and a terrestrial component around their spectrum holdings. in addition, some
        of our competitors have announced plans for the launch of additional satellites.
        as a result of competition, we may not be able to successfully retain our
        existing customers and attract new customers.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nin addition
        to our satellite-based competitors, terrestrial voice and data service providers,
        both wireline and wireless, could further expand into rural and remote areas
        and provide the same general types of services and products that we provide
        through our satellite-based system. although satellite communications services
        and terrestrial communications services are not perfect substitutes, the two
        compete in some markets and for some services. consumers generally perceive
        terrestrial wireless voice communication products and services as cheaper
        and more convenient than those that are satellite-based. many of our terrestrial
        competitors have greater resources, wider name recognition and newer technologies
        than we do. in addition, industry consolidation could hurt us by increasing
        the scale or scope of our competitors, thereby making it more difficult for
        us to compete.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nsome

        hardware and software we use in operating our gateway was designed and manufactured
        over ten years ago, and portions are becoming obsolete. as they continue to
        age, they may become less reliable and will be more difficult and expensive
        to service, upgrade or replace. although we maintain inventories of some spare
        parts, it nonetheless may be difficult or impossible to obtain all necessary
        replacement parts for the hardware. our business plan contemplates updating
        or replacing some of the hardware and software in our network, but the age
        of our existing hardware and software may present us with technical and operational
        challenges that complicate or otherwise make it infeasible to carry out our
        planned upgrades and replacements, and the expenditure of resources, both
        from a monetary and human capital perspective, may exceed our estimates. if
        we are not able to suitably upgrade and replace our equipment, obsolescence
        of the technologies that we use could hurt our ability to provide our services
        and therefore to generate revenue.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nrapid and significant
        technological changes in the satellite communications industry may impair
        our competitive position and require us to make significant additional capital
        expenditures.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nthe satellite communications industry is subject
        to rapid advances and innovations in technology. we may face competition in
        the future from companies using new technologies and new satellite systems.
        new technology could render our system obsolete or less competitive by satisfying
        customer demand in more attractive ways or through the introduction of incompatible
        standards. particular technological developments that could adversely affect
        us include the deployment by our competitors of new satellites with greater
        power, flexibility, efficiency or capabilities than our current constellation
        or iridium next, as well as continuing improvements in terrestrial wireless
        technologies. for us to keep up with technological changes and remain competitive,
        we may need to make significant capital expenditures, including capital to
        design and launch new products and services on iridium next, which are not
        included in our current cost estimates. customer acceptance of the products
        and services that we offer will continually be affected by technology-based
        differences in our product and service offerings compared to those of our
        competitors. new technologies may also be protected by patents or other intellectual
        property laws and therefore may not be available to us. any failure on our
        part to implement new technology within our system may compromise our ability
        to compete.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nuse by our competitors of l-band spectrum for
        terrestrial services could interfere with our services.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nin
        february 2003, the fcc adopted atc rules that permit satellite service providers
        to establish terrestrial wireless networks in previously satellite-only bands,
        subject to certain requirements intended to ensure that terrestrial services
        remain ancillary to primary satellite operations. in november 2012, globalstar
        filed a petition for rulemaking, asking the fcc to permit it to provide terrestrial
        service in l-band spectrum and to eliminate the requirements for primary satellite
        operations, which we are opposing. the implementation of atc services by satellite
        service providers in the united states or other countries may result in increased
        competition for the right to use l-band spectrum in the 1.6 ghz band, which
        we use to provide our services, and such competition may make it difficult
        for us to obtain or retain the spectrum resources we require for our existing
        and future services. in addition, the fcc\u2019s decision to permit atc services
        was based on assumptions relating to the level of interference that the provision
        of atc services would likely cause to other satellite service providers that
        use the l-band spectrum. if the fcc\u2019s assumptions prove inaccurate, or
        the level of atc services provided exceeds those estimated by the fcc, atc
        services could interfere with our satellites and devices, which may adversely
        affect our services. outside the united states, other countries have implemented
        or are considering implementing regulations to facilitate atc-like services.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nour
        networks and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable
        to security risks.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe expect the secure transmission of confidential
        information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our
        ability to compete for business and protect our customers and our reputation.
        our network and those of our third-party service providers and our customers
        may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security
        problems. persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully obtain
        or use information on the network or cause interruptions, delays or malfunctions
        in our operations, any of which could harm our reputation, cause demand for
        our products and services to fall and compromise our ability to pursue our
        business plans. recently, there have been reported a number of significant,
        widespread security breaches that have compromised network integrity for many
        companies and governmental agencies, in some cases reportedly originating
        from outside the united states. in addition, there are reportedly private
        products available in the market today which attempt to unlawfully intercept
        communications made on our network. we may be required to expend significant
        resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate
        problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches.
        in addition, our customer contracts may not adequately protect us against
        liability to third parties with whom our customers conduct business. although
        we have implemented and intend to continue to implement industry-standard
        security measures, these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in
        system failures and delays that could lower network availability, which could
        harm our business and our reputation.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe are dependent on third parties to market
        and sell our products and services.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe rely on third-party
        distributors to market and sell our products and services to end users and
        to determine the prices end users pay. we also depend on our distributors
        to develop innovative and improved solutions and applications integrating
        our product and service offerings. as a result of these arrangements, we are
        dependent on the performance of our distributors to generate substantially
        all of our revenue. our distributors operate independently of us, and we have
        limited control over their operations, which exposes us to significant risks.
        distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our
        products and services and may also market and sell competitive products and
        services. in addition, our distributors may not comply with the laws and regulatory
        requirements in their local jurisdictions, which could limit their ability
        to market or sell our products and services. if our distributors develop faulty
        or poorly performing products using our technology or services, we may be
        subject to claims, and our reputation could be harmed. if current or future
        distributors do not perform adequately, or if we are unable to locate competent
        distributors in particular countries and secure their services on favorable
        terms, we may be unable to increase or maintain our revenue in these markets
        or enter new markets, we may not realize our expected growth, and our brand
        image and reputation could be hurt.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nin addition, we may lose
        distributors due to competition, consolidation, regulatory developments, business
        developments affecting our distributors or their customers, or for other reasons.
        in 2009, one of our largest competitors, inmarsat, acquired our then largest
        distributor, stratos global wireless, inc. inmarsat does not dedicate the
        same level of effort to distributing our products and services as did stratos
        and may further reduce such efforts in the future. for example, inmarsat has
        essentially stopped promoting sales of our handsets. in addition, in january
        2014, inmarsat acquired globe wireless, one of our service providers, and
        we can provide no assurance that inmarsat will dedicate the same level of
        effort to distributing our products and services as globe wireless did. any
        future consolidation of our distributors would further increase our reliance
        on a few key distributors of our services and the amount of volume discounts
        that we may have to give such distributors. our two largest distributors,
        airbus defense and space and inmarsat, each represented 8% of our revenue
        for the year ended december 31, 2013, and our ten largest distributors represented,
        in the aggregate, 43% of our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2013.
        the loss of any of these distributors, or a decrease in the level of effort
        expended by any of them to promote our products and services, could reduce
        the distribution of our products and services as well as the development of
        new products and applications.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe rely on a limited number
        of key vendors for supply of equipment and services.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe rely
        on two single-source contracts for the manufacture of our current devices,
        including our mobile handsets, l-band transceivers and short-burst data devices.
        either of these manufacturers may choose to terminate its business relationship
        with us when its current contractual obligations are completed, or at such
        earlier time as contemplated by our current agreement. if a manufacturer terminates
        its relationship with us, we may not be able to find a replacement supplier
        in a timely manner, at an acceptable price, or at all. we are highly dependent
        on these manufacturers\u2019 performance as the sole suppliers of our devices.
        we also utilize sole source suppliers for some of the component parts of our
        devices.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nthese manufacturers and suppliers may become capacity-constrained
        as a result of a surge in demand, a natural disaster or other event, resulting
        in a shortage or interruption in supplies or an inability to meet increased
        demand. although we might be able to replace sole source suppliers, there
        could be a substantial period of time in which our products would not be available;
        any new relationship may involve higher costs and delays in development and
        delivery, and we might encounter technical challenges in successfully replicating
        the manufacturing processes. if our manufacturers or suppliers terminate their
        relationships with us, fail to provide equipment or services to us on a timely
        basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we might be unable to
        provide products or services to our customers in a competitive manner, which
        could in turn negatively affect our financial results and our reputation.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nin
        addition, we depend on boeing to provide operations and maintenance services
        with respect to our satellite network, including engineering, systems analysis,
        integration and testing of new equipment and operations and maintenance services,
        from our technical support center in chandler, arizona and our satellite network
        operations center in leesburg, virginia. technological competence is critical
        to our business and depends, to a significant degree, on the work of technically
        skilled personnel, such as our boeing contractors. if boeing\u2019s performance
        falls below expected levels or if boeing has difficulties retaining the personnel
        servicing our network, the operations of our satellite network could be compromised.
        in addition, if boeing terminates its agreement with us, we may not be able
        to find a replacement provider on favorable terms or at all, which could impair
        the operations and performance of our network. replacing boeing as the operator
        of our satellite system could also trigger de-orbit rights held by the u.s.
        government, which, if exercised, would eliminate our ability to offer satellite
        communications services altogether.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe have been and may
        in the future become subject to claims that our products violate the patent
        or intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and disruptive
        to us.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant
        intellectual property litigation. as a result, we or our products may become
        subject to intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. the defense
        of intellectual property suits is both costly and time-consuming, even if
        ultimately successful, and may divert management\u2019s attention from other
        business concerns. an adverse determination in litigation to which we may
        become a party could, among other things:\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\n\\n

        the united states creates numerous risks, which may harm our operations and
        compromise our ability to expand our international operations.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe
        have significant operations outside the united states. according to our estimates,
        commercial data traffic originating outside the united states, excluding iridium
        openport traffic, accounted for 67% of total commercial data traffic for the
        year ended december\u00a031, 2013, while commercial voice traffic originating
        outside the united states, excluding iridium openport traffic, accounted for
        90% of total commercial voice traffic for the year ended december\u00a031,
        2013. we cannot provide the precise geographical distribution of revenue from
        end users because we do not contract directly with them. instead, we determine
        the country in which we earn our revenue based on where we invoice our distributors.
        these distributors sell services directly or indirectly to end users, who
        may be located or use our products and services elsewhere. we and our distributors
        are also seeking authorization to sell our services in additional countries.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nconducting
        operations outside the united states involves numerous special risks and,

        for us to grow internationally.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe are currently unable to
        offer service in important regions of the world due to regulatory requirements,
        which limits our growth.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nour ability to provide service in
        some regions is limited by local regulations. some countries have specific
        regulatory requirements such as local domestic ownership requirements or requirements
        for physical gateways within their jurisdiction to connect traffic coming
        to and from their territory. while we have had discussions with parties in
        these countries to satisfy these regulatory requirements, we may not be able
        to find an acceptable local partner or reach an agreement to develop additional
        gateways, or the cost of developing and deploying such gateways may be prohibitive,
        which could impair our ability to expand our product and service offerings
        in such areas and undermine our value for potential users who require service
        in these areas. also, other countries where we already provide service may
        impose similar requirements, which could restrict our ability to continue
        to provide service in those countries. the inability to offer to sell our
        products and services in all major international markets could impair our
        international growth. in addition, the construction of such gateways in foreign
        countries may trigger and require us to comply with various u.s. regulatory
        requirements that could conflict with or contravene the laws or regulations
        of the local jurisdiction. any of these developments could limit, delay or
        otherwise interfere with our ability to construct gateways or other infrastructure
        or network solutions around the world.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nthe u.s. government,

        llc out of bankruptcy, boeing, motorola and the u.s. government required specified
        de-orbit rights as a way to control potential liability risk arising from
        future operation of the constellation. as a result, iridium satellite, boeing,
        motorola and the u.s. government entered into an agreement giving the u.s.
        government the right to, in its sole discretion, require us to de-orbit our
        constellation upon the occurrence of specified events, including if more than
        four of our satellites have insufficient fuel to execute a 12-month de-orbit,
        which is currently the case.\u00a0 in addition, the u.s. government has the
        right to require us to de-orbit any of our individual functioning satellites,
        including in-orbit spares that have been in orbit for more than seven years,
        unless the u.s. government grants a postponement. all of our functioning satellites
        have been in orbit for more than seven years.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nmotorola solutions,

        occurrence of specified events.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe cannot guarantee that
        the u.s. government, motorola solutions or boeing will not unilaterally exercise
        their de-orbiting rights upon the occurrence of any of the specified events.
        if we were required to de-orbit our constellation, we would be unable to continue
        to provide mobile satellite communications services.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe may
        be unable to obtain and maintain contractually required liability insurance,
        and the insurance we obtain may not cover all liabilities to which we may
        become subject.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nunder our agreement with motorola, we are
        required to maintain an in-orbit liability insurance policy with a de-orbiting
        endorsement. the current policy, together with the de-orbiting endorsement,
        covers amounts that we and other specified parties may become liable to pay
        for bodily injury and property damages to third parties related to processing,
        maintaining and operating our satellite constellation and, in the case of
        the de-orbiting endorsement, de-orbiting our satellite constellation. our
        current policy has a one-year term, which expires on december\u00a08, 2014,
        and excludes coverage for all third-party damages relating to the 2009 collision
        of our satellite with a non-operational russian satellite. the price, terms
        and availability of insurance have fluctuated significantly since we began
        offering commercial satellite services. the cost of obtaining insurance can
        vary as a result of either satellite failures or general conditions in the
        insurance industry. higher premiums on insurance policies would increase our
        cost. in-orbit liability insurance policies on satellites may not continue
        to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. in addition to
        higher premiums, insurance policies may provide for higher deductibles, shorter
        coverage periods and additional policy exclusions. for example, our current
        de-orbit insurance covers only twelve months from attachment and therefore
        would not cover losses arising outside that timeframe. our failure to renew
        our current in-orbit liability insurance policy or obtain a replacement policy
        would trigger de-orbit rights held by the u.s. government and boeing described
        in the immediately preceding risk factor, which, if exercised, would eliminate
        our ability to provide mobile satellite communications services. in addition,
        even if we continue to maintain an in-orbit liability insurance policy, the
        coverage may not protect us against all third-party losses, which could be
        material.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nour
        current in-orbit liability insurance policy contains, and we expect any future
        policies would likewise contain, specified exclusions and material change
        limitations customary in the industry. these exclusions may relate to, among
        other things, losses resulting from in-orbit collisions such as the one we
        experienced in 2009, acts of war, insurrection, terrorism or military action,
        government confiscation, strikes, riots, civil commotions, labor disturbances,
        sabotage, unauthorized use of the satellites and nuclear or radioactive contamination,
        as well as claims directly or indirectly occasioned as a result of noise,
        pollution, electrical and electromagnetic interference and interference with
        the use of property.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nin addition to our in-orbit liability
        insurance policy, we are required to purchase product liability insurance
        to cover the potential liability of motorola solutions, as the manufacturer
        of the satellites in our current constellation. we may not in the future be
        able to renew this product liability coverage on reasonable terms and conditions,
        or at all. our failure to maintain this insurance could increase our exposure
        to third-party damages that may be caused by any of our satellites. as described
        elsewhere in this report, if we are unable to obtain such insurance on commercially
        reasonable terms and the u.s. government has not agreed to cover the amounts
        that would have otherwise been paid by such insurance, motorola solutions
        could invoke its de-orbit rights which, if exercised, would eliminate our
        ability to provide mobile satellite communications services.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwireless

        other claims allege consumer harm from failures to disclose information about
        radio frequency emissions or aspects of the regulatory regimes governing those
        emissions. although we have not been party to any such lawsuits, we may be
        exposed to such litigation in the future. while we comply with applicable
        standards for radio frequency emissions and power and do not believe that
        there is valid scientific evidence that use of our phones poses a health risk,
        courts or governmental agencies could determine otherwise. any such finding
        could reduce our revenue and profitability and expose us and other wireless

        by similar local authorities. the rules and regulations of these u.s. and
        foreign authorities may change, and such authorities may adopt regulations
        that limit or restrict our operations as presently conducted or currently
        contemplated. such authorities may also make changes in the licenses of our

        failure to provide services in accordance with the terms of our licenses or
        our failure to operate our satellites or ground stations as required by our
        licenses and applicable laws and government regulations could result in the
        imposition of government sanctions on us, including the suspension or cancellation
        of our licenses. our failure or delay in obtaining the approvals required

        1. business\\n\u00a0\\nenvision designs, engineers,\\nfabricates, and installs
        solar products and proprietary technology solutions. the company focuses on
        creating high quality products\\nwhich transform both surface and top deck
        parking lots of commercial, institutional, governmental and other customers
        into shaded\\nrenewable generation plants while creating sustainable media
        and branding assets and contributing to the growth of electric vehicle\\ncharging
        infrastructure. management believes that the company''s chief differentiator
        is its ability to design and engineer architecturally\\naccretive solar products
        which are a complex integration of simple, commonly available engineered components.
        the resulting products\\nare built to have the longest life expectancy in
        the industry while also delivering a highly appealing architectural enhancement\\nto
        our customer\u2019s locations. management believes that envision''s products
        deliver multiple layers of value such as media,\\nbranding, and advertising
        platforms, architectural enhancement of the parking lot, reduction of heat
        islanding and improved parking\\nexperiences through shading, high visibility
        \"green halo\" branding, reduction of net operating costs through reduced\\nutility
        bills and the creation of an iconic luxury landmark where simple parking previously
        existed.\\n\u00a0\\nproducts and technologies\\n\u00a0\\nthe company''s solar\\ntree\u00ae
        structure has been in deployment and continued improvement for over seven
        years. during the last three years, the solar\\ntree\u00ae structure was redesigned
        from the ground up to incorporate all of the best attributes of previous designs.
        we believe\\nthe resulting product has become the standard of quality in solar
        shaded parking and while there are an increasing number of competitors\\nin
        the space, we believe there is no competing product which includes all of
        the important attributes of the solar tree\u00ae structure.\\nwe understand
        it to be the only single column, bio mimicked, tracking, and architectural
        solar support structure designed specifically\\nfor parking lots.\\n\u00a0\\nthe
        company has designed\\nand incorporated envisiontrak\u2122, its proprietary
        and patent pending tracking solution, to the solar tree\u00ae structure, furthering\\nthe
        unique nature of the product and we believe increasing the company''s technological
        leadership within the industry. we believe\\nenvisiontrak\u2122 is a complex
        integration of the highest quality gearing, electrical motors and controls
        which are combined\\nin a robust, highly engineered and supremely reliable
        manner. while there are many tracking solutions available to the solar industry,\\nwe
        believe envsiontrak\u2122 is the only tracking solution which causes the solar
        array to orient itself in alignment with the\\nsun without swinging, rotating
        or leaving its lineal alignment with the parking spaces below. we believe
        this is a vital attribute\\nin solar shaded parking as any swinging or rotating
        of the arrays could result in impeding the flow of traffic, particularly first\\nresponders
        such as fire trucks, in the drive aisles. it is a violation of many local
        codes to have restricted overhead clearance\\nin the drive aisles. envisiontrak\u2122
        has been demonstrated, through data obtained from our past customers, to increase
        electrical\\nproduction, but perhaps a greater value is the high visual appeal
        created by solar tree\u00ae structures which are tracking the\\nsun in perfect
        synchronicity.\\n\u00a0\\nthe solar tree\u00ae\\nstructure\u2019s canopy measures
        35''x35'' and covers between six and eight parking spaces. envision has also
        developed a single\\nparking space version of the product that leverages the
        same technology, components, and architectural qualities, but is one tenth\\nthe
        size and less expensive. the solar tree\u00ae socket is designed for tight
        locations and offers customer budget flexibility.\\nit has been produced by
        the company to broaden the addressable market for its technology.\\n\u00a0\\nenvision
        continues\\nto identify other complimentary product offerings and enhancements
        to current offerings, and is in the design phase on certain\\nsuch products.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n1\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nleveraging
        the structural\\nand technological attributes of its existing products, the
        company has developed a new product called ev arc\u2122 and delivered\\nthe
        first units of this product line during the quarter ended september 30, 2013.
        we believe ev arc\u2122 (electric vehicle autonomous\\nrenewable charger)
        solves many of the problems associated with electric vehicle charging infrastructure
        deployments and is a product\\nwith a potentially very large addressable market.
        until now, the deployment of electrical vehicle (\u201cev\u201d) chargers
        has\\nbeen significantly hindered by complications in the site acquisition
        process caused by the complicated and invasive processes required\\nto fulfill
        the installation. each ev charger requires a pedestal which is mounted to
        a poured concrete foundation which first requires\\nexcavation. chargers also
        require a trench run to deliver grid connected electricity, and often require
        transformers and other\\nlocal electrical equipment upgrades. additional entitlements,
        easements, leases and other site acquisition requirements will slow,\\nor
        prevent entirely, the deployment of large numbers of chargers. when an ev
        charger is deployed successfully, the host may be\\nliable for increased kilowatt
        hour charges and often, more expensive demand charges. landlords often do
        not perceive enough value\\ncreation in the deployment of an ev charger, and
        as such, are not inclined to grant permission to the service providers who
        approach\\nthem.\\n\u00a0\\nwe believe ev arc\u2122\\nchanges this paradigm
        completely because it is entirely self-contained and can be delivered to the
        site ready to operate. its ballasted\\npad contains battery storage and creates
        a structurally sound platform which will support the rest of the structure.
        the solar\\narray structure is similar to our socket\u2122 product, and through
        our envisiontrak\u2122 tracking solution, is column mounted\\nto the ballasted
        pad. there is an electrical cabinet which is attractively integrated into
        the unit and in which various components\\nenable the conversion of sunlight
        to electricity which is stored in batteries, and the delivery of that electricity
        to the ev charging\\nstation. incorporating battery storage means that ev
        arc\u2122 can charge day or night. ev arc\u2122 delivers a clean source\\nof
        power to any model of ev charger that is integrated into the structure. envision
        solar continues to maintain a vendor agnostic\\nstance in regards to ev charging,
        and as such, ev arc\u2122 is designed to accept whichever ev charger the end
        customer chooses.\\nthe ev arc\u2122 can be set up to charge a single ev or
        multiple electric scooters or smaller electric vehicles. in this early\\nstage
        of the production evolution for the ev arc\u2122 and low volumes, the company
        believes the appropriate selling price point\\nis lower than the actual initial
        costs of production. management believes that certain production elements
        will mature allowing\\nfor gross profit on future sales later in 2014. these
        elements include production economies of scale, lower costs of components\\nincluding
        the cost of battery storage which is currently a significant cost contributor,
        as well as design changes to allow for\\nimproved production processes.\\n\u00a0\\nev
        arc\u2122 is designed\\nto address the sizable market of ev charging infrastructure.
        the current lack of such infrastructure is the single greatest impediment\\nto
        the adoption of evs in the us and elsewhere. a standardized, easily deployable
        ev charger, which is renewably energized rather\\nthan relying on carbon based
        electrical energy, would appear to have significant appeal to those entities
        which are interested\\nin the proliferation of ev charging infrastructure.
        management believes that the ev arc\u2122 should generate significant volumes\\nof
        sales in the coming months and years. we believe no competing company has
        a similar product, so the company\u2019s first-to-market\\nposition should
        create an opportunity for a share in the market interest.\\n\u00a0\\nwe strive
        to produce\\nproducts integrating only the highest quality components available.
        the company''s production philosophy is to invest in quality\\ndesign, components
        and integration so as to ensure the lowest costs of warranty and service in
        the industry, while maintaining\\nand growing a brand which is already recognized
        as one of the leading producers of the highest quality solar products available.\\n\u00a0\\nthe
        company produces\\na series of products which management believes offer multiple
        layers of value to its customers leveraging the same underlying technology\\nand
        fabrication techniques and infrastructure. this enables the company to reach
        a broad customer base with varied product offerings\\nwithout maintaining
        the overhead normally associated with a diverse set of products.\\n\u00a0\\nthe
        company\u2019s\\ncurrent list of products include:\\n\u00a0\\n\\n1.the solar
        tree\u00ae standard structure, a thirty five foot square solar array mounted
        on a single\\ncolumn,\\n\\n2.the branded solar tree\u00ae (hvba) structure

        screens.\\n\u00a0\\nenvision leverages\\na combination of in-house and outsourced
        resources to create its products. management believes that the company has
        significant\\noperating leverage through the deliberate separation of intellectual
        property creation (in-house) and the actual deployment of\\nthe company''s
        products (outsourced). all intellectual property is developed in-house. product
        designs are then vetted by third-party\\nstructural and electrical engineering
        firms to ensure that the designs meet the jurisdictional requirements and
        codifications for\\nthe deployment locations. we believe this further helps
        dissipate any potential liabilities for the structural and electrical elements\\nby
        providing additional insured parties with partial responsibility for the designs.
        architectural, structural, and electrical\\ndesign elements are combined into
        shop and deployment documents that can be exported to a vetted, qualified
        stable of fabrication\\nand deployment resources.\\n\u00a0\\nit is the company\u2019s\\nintention
        to create a limited fabrication facility in the future in which the structural
        components of its mainstay products will\\nbe optimized and fabricated. we
        believe an in-house fabrication facility may enable the company to reduce
        direct costs associated\\nwith individual products. we believe the facility
        will further enable the company to make improvements to existing products
        and\\nalso to introduce new products in a much more timely and efficient manner.
        management believes that the product development process\\ncan be significantly
        faster and less expensive when carried out by an in-house fabrication facility.
        we believe one of the most\\nsignificant risks currently faced by the company
        is its reliance upon outsourced fabrication, and the delays and costs associated\\nwith
        this model. the standardized and broadly repurposed components which comprise
        the company\u2019s product set do not require\\nan expensive fabrication facility.
        in fact, the line required can be narrow, limited and highly efficient, thus
        not requiring significant\\ninvestment or human resources. the company intends
        to continue to outsource installation and deployment of its products, and
        as\\nfurther improvements and standards are attained, it is management\u2019s
        belief the company can continue to reduce (a) the amount\\nof installation
        resources required in the field and (b) the company\u2019s need to supervise
        those resources. the company intends\\nto rely on outsourced fabrication resources
        when growth or high order volume makes it necessary.\\n\u00a0\\nmanagement
        believes\\nthat the continuation of the company\u2019s strategy to create
        highly engineered, highly scalable products which are delivered\\nas a kit
        of parts to the customer site, and which require minimal field labor activities,
        is further positioning the company as\\na provider of products which are complex
        but standardized and easily deployable and which reduces the exposure of the
        company to\\nthe risks and inherent margin erosion that are incumbent in field
        deployments. the company intends to continue to work with its\\nexisting fabrication
        partners and also qualify new resources so that spikes in product demand can
        be buffered through the use of\\noutsourced resources if and while the company\u2019s
        in-sourced fabrication facility is scaled to achieve any new levels of production.\\nwe
        believe the growth which the company anticipates in the future is attainable
        through this highly scalable model. the products\\nare standardized, scalable
        and highly repeatable. the documentation and deployment processes that the
        company is creating are highly\\ndetailed and explanatory, thus enabling a
        growing pool of qualified sub-contracted resources to fabricate and deploy
        the products\\nwithout being dilutive to quality. the company places high
        emphasis on qualifying and vetting sub-contracted resources because\\nof the
        significant portion of the company''s shareholder value attributable to brand
        value.\\n\u00a0\\nthe company continues\\nto bring engineering and design
        improvements to its products that are designed to increase the level of standardization
        and reduce\\nthe field labor and effort required for product deployment. wherever
        possible, the components of the solar tree\u00ae structures\\nare factory
        integrated and assembled such that complete assemblies are delivered to the
        sites with a regularly decreasing level\\nof field installation activity required.
        this allows the company to reduce risks associated with field work such as
        weather, labor\\ndeficiencies, and accidents. our strategy also enables us
        to control future labor costs through mass production in a factory environment\\nand
        the avoidance of prevailing wage, union, or other labor related conditions
        that are outside of the company''s control on deployment\\nsites. this improvement
        in products, standardization, and modularization has enabled the company to
        significantly reduce field\\ndeployment timeframes.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n3\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nenvision''s

        market\\n\u00a0\\ndistributed generation\\nphotovoltaic solar projects have
        historically been rooftop or adjacent property installations. rooftops have
        a number of inherent\\nproblems that are avoided by utilizing parking lots
        and the top levels of parking structures for solar installations. rooftops\\nare
        populated with mechanical equipment, vents, skylights, elevator overruns and
        most importantly, roofing materials and systems\\nincluding waterproof membranes
        that require maintenance, are warranted, and must be replaced often \u2013
        more often than solar\\npv products. rooftops are also limited in the area
        which is required for large scale energy production by pv systems. the low
        returns\\ngenerated by many roof top and adjacent property solar deployments
        are often not sufficient inducement to a real estate owner,\\ndeveloper or
        tenant to expose themselves to the encumbrance and risks associated with those
        sorts of deployments, which in part\\nexplains the relatively low adoption
        of this otherwise beneficial technology.\\n\u00a0\\nthere are over 800\\nmillion
        parking spaces in the united states. we believe parking lots, and the top
        levels of parking structures, are preferable\\nlocations, in many cases, to
        building rooftops for numerous reasons, which accounts for the rapid growth
        of the solar parking array\\nmarket. they are large, unobstructed, sun-drenched
        areas that are easily accessible during project construction. they have no
        waterproofing\\nissues and benefit significantly from shade for cars and drivers.
        in addition, the company emphasizes \u201csolar you can see!\u201d\\nbecause
        rooftop solar can\u2019t be seen in most cases. solar parking arrays, on the
        other hand, are experienced and enjoyed by\\nemployees and visitors. with
        the installation of a solar parking array, a previously barren and unpleasant
        parking lot could become\\na cool, shady, people friendly park where everyone
        can directly experience clean solar energy generation, shade, and soft safe\\nlighting
        at night. we believe property owners will enjoy the benefits of the positive
        demonstration such a visible display of the\\nsustainable design of their
        properties are and turn a cost centers into revenue centers. as the adoption
        of electric vehicles increase,\\nwe believe parking lots will be an ideal
        location for ev charging infrastructure and envision\u2019s products with
        suncharge\u2122\\nwill offer a very attractive option to any entity considering
        the deployment of such solutions.\\n\u00a0\\nmarket verticals\\n\u00a0\\nenvision

        such as television, radio, and print diminishes, advertisers in the united
        states and abroad are\\nlooking for new outlets to capture the attention of
        consumers. management believes there will be significant growth in spending\\non
        outdoor advertising platforms such as billboards. we believe this is particularly
        true relative to digital content. the dooh\\n(digital out of home) industry
        is enjoying a period of rapid growth and is set to continue to do so for the
        foreseeable future.\\nmanagement has seen statistics suggesting dooh and other
        outdoor advertising spending will exceed $7b in the united states and\\n$25b
        globally in 2014, with massive potential markets such as china just beginning
        to enter the marketplace.\\n\u00a0\\nwhile we\\nbelieve there is a great deal
        of pent up appetite for billboard spending in the united states, there are
        also significant barriers\\nto the widespread deployment of the infrastructure:\\n\u00a0\\n\\na)entitlement

        solar has products that solve each of the above impediments to billboard and
        dooh infrastructure deployments.\\n\u00a0\\nbecause the\\nenvision solar products
        are renewably energized, they are shrouded in what is often referred to as
        the \u201cgreen halo.\u201d\\nwe believe that the green/sustainable aspect
        of our products makes them more likely to win approval through the entitlement
        process,\\nwhile also making them more popular with an increasingly environmentally-conscious
        public. the dual effect, we believe, is that\\nour products may be deployable
        in locations where traditional billboards may be denied. we believe these
        products will be more\\npopular with an advertisers\u2019 intended audience
        and, as a result, advertisers may be willing to pay for them either as a capital\\npurchase
        or through any existing payment schedule they have with vendors such as lemar,
        clear channel or jc decaux. envision plans\\nto sell product (and perhaps
        in the future rent or lease) either directly to the end user or to one of
        the brokerages. we do not\\ncurrently intend to sell space to content providers
        as there are other well established companies doing that to which we can sell.\\n\u00a0\\nbecause
        our\\nproducts produce more energy than they consume through the displaying
        of advertising content, they do not have ongoing operating\\nexpenses associated
        with energy costs. in fact, they can also support other local energy requirements
        such as lighting or, even\\nmore politically important, ev charging infrastructure.\\n\u00a0\\neach
        of our\\nproducts can be equipped with a wan (wide area network) connection
        that can be used to monitor the condition and performance of\\nthe unit. this
        wan connection can be used equally to deliver content updates to our product\u2019s
        advertising screens and to\\nnetwork the products so that they can be intelligently
        linked to one another as well as to local consumers through nfc (near field\\ncommunications).\\n\u00a0\\n\\n2.electric
        vehicle charging\\n\\n\u00a0\\nwhile the\\ngrowth rates in electric vehicle
        sales and, as a result, the requirements for supporting infrastructure are
        impressive, to date,\\nthe deployment of electric vehicle service equipment
        (\u201cevse\u201d) has not met the goals set by the department of energy\\n(\u201cdoe\u201d)
        or any of the larger companies currently engaged in the space. the reasons
        for the delays are manifold but\\nthe main impediments include the following:\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\na)site
        acquisition \u2013 identifying and leasing/controlling locations,\\n\\nb)entitlement
        \u2013 permitting and zoning requirements,\\n\\nc)civil works \u2013 foundations

        \u2013 sources and cost of energy,\\n\\nf)telemetry \u2013 communications
        with the ev chargers.\\n\u00a0\u00a0\\nwe believe\\nthe envision solar ev
        arc\u2122 is the world\u2019s first and only transportable, solar powered
        evse. it arrives on site ready\\nto operate. it resides inside a single parking
        space atop a ballasted pad, which negates the requirement for a foundation
        and makes\\nit capable of withstanding 120 mph winds. because it produces
        and stores all its own energy, it does not need a grid connection\\nand therefore
        needs no trenching, switch gear, or transformer upgrades. management believes
        the lack of a foundation or trench\\nmeans that in most jurisdictions the
        ev arc\u2122 will not need a building permit. it is immune to grid interruptions
        such as\\nblack outs or brown outs. as such, it will allow for vehicle charging
        even in times of emergency. it can be moved at any time because\\nit is not
        connected to the ground or grid, and we believe, creates an attractive and
        highly visible branding asset for the host.\\nthere are no utility bills to
        pay and, as the number of evs increase on the host campuses; more ev arc\u2122
        units can be added\\nin minutes with a continued lack of disruption.\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        believe\\nthese factors make the ev arc\u2122 a very compelling value proposition
        to anyone who intends to install such devices. a corporate\\ncustomer can
        deploy ev charging quickly, efficiently, and without digging up its parking
        lots. the positive carbon foot print impact\\nis greater because the ev arc\u2122
        uses sunlight to charge the employees\u2019 evs and, we believe, the marketing
        and branding\\nimpact is far greater because the enterprise has a highly visible
        demonstration of its commitment to the environment.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n6\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        believe\\nenvision solar\u2019s larger solar tree\u00ae structures also make
        perfect evse locations. considering the list of impediments\\nto ev infrastructure
        deployments, we believe that the solar tree\u00ae structure with column integrated
        cleancharge\u2122 ev chargers\\noffers significant advantages over a typical
        grid tied ev charger. we believe that they offer the most attractive and practical\\nmounting
        assets for fixed ev charging stations. the single column design is ideal for
        centrally locating multiple chargers and\\nmaking them available to the maximum
        number of spaces. entitlement can go more smoothly because the solar tree\u00ae
        structures\\ncontribute more benefits to the local environment than simple
        ev chargers. those additional benefits include shade, reduction in\\nheat
        islanding, reduction in light pollution, architectural accretion, reduction
        in grid stress, and even disaster preparedness\\nwhen equipped with arc\u2122
        technology. we believe that commercial real estate owners and corporate campuses
        will recognize the\\nmultiple layers of increased value delivered by solar
        tree\u00ae structures and cleancharge\u2122 deployed with little disruption\\nto
        their facilities.\\n\u00a0\\nsolar tree\u00ae\\nstructures with arc\u2122
        technology energy storage generate and store enough energy to fully charge
        6 to 8 evs each day. they\\ncan be deployed in any location that is not shaded
        and does not require any utility grid connection. we believe that this vital\\nfactor
        makes them the compelling choice for remote locations where there is inadequate
        utility grid connection (e.g. remote rest\\nareas) or where the requirement
        is for charging of mission critical vehicles (e.g. first responders, hospitals).
        it is our further\\ncontention that any campus environment with an ev charging
        need and a wish for a high degree of reliability in its electrical supply\\ncan
        benefit from our solar tree\u00ae structures with arc\u2122 on-board energy
        storage because, we believe, in times of grid instability\\n(e.g. natural
        disaster, terrorism, capacity constraints), the envision solar products could
        provide the most reliable source of\\nenergy at the location.\\n\u00a0\\nmanagement\\nbelieves
        that so called \u201crange anxiety\u201d is one of the top two reasons that
        customers are not buying evs. we believe\\nthat our products can contribute
        in a significant and material manner to reducing range anxiety. as a result,
        we believe that any\\ncompany or governmental entity that views the roll out
        of ev charging infrastructure as important to its business could reasonably\\nbe
        expected to become our customer.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n3.shade and energy production\\n\\n\u00a0\\nenvision\\nsolar
        was initially conceived as an entity structured to provide architectural and
        design services to customers looking for shaded\\nparking solutions. the company
        invented the solar tree\u00ae product line that we believe still provides
        the best option for solar\\nand shade generation in parking lots. now, with
        the introduction of the newest envision product, the solar tree\u00ae hvlc
        (high\\nvalue low cost) array, we believe that we can be competitive in many
        purely energy focused projects as well.\\n\u00a0\\nwe believe\\nthere are
        at least 800 million parking spaces in the united states today. each of our
        solar tree\u00ae products covers six to eight\\nparking spaces. the top deck
        of a typical parking structure accommodates 20 to 30 solar tree\u00ae structures.
        anyone who has looked\\nout of the window of an airplane knows the enormity
        of the opportunity associated with creating shade and renewable energy in
        parking\\nlots. while this is the most cost sensitive and competitive market
        we are approaching, the size of the market, and significant\\nimprovements
        in our ability to address that market, lead the management to believe that
        we can win a meaningful portion of this\\nmarket.\\n\u00a0\\nwe believe,\\nglobally,
        solar deployments are growing significantly. while much of the growth has
        been focused on low-cost solutions, we believe\\nthat there will be a shift
        towards quality over cost as the market matures and the reduced costs of commoditized
        components allow\\nfor higher quality deployments while still approaching
        or even surpassing grid parity. our deployment speed is also important to\\nour
        marketing efforts. in most cases, we deploy our solar tree\u00ae products
        in active parking lots of active businesses. whether\\nwe are deploying for
        shade or for marketing purposes, our prospective customers often consider
        business disruption in their analysis\\nand buying decisions. we believe that
        we can perform the fastest deployment in the industry, making deployment of
        envision products\\nless negatively impactful than the deployment of our competitor\u2019s
        products. the potential loss of revenue or opportunity\\ncaused by a torn-up
        parking lot can, over time, be quite substantial. we believe our deployment
        speed will increasingly contribute\\nto envision\u2019s competitive edge.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n7\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\ncustomer
        concentration\\n\u00a0\\nduring 2013, the company\\nhad three customers that
        each exceeded 10% of our revenue. although we will continue to market and
        sell to these same entities,\\nthe revenues were for independent product sales
        or project based sales which conclude with installations, there is no continued\\neffect
        or relationship to any future revenues from these sources or others.\\n\u00a0\\ncompetition\\n\u00a0\\nthe
        solar energy industry\\nis intensely competitive. we are subject to competition
        from a number of other companies manufacturing, selling, and installing\\nsolar
        power products in the commercial market, many of which have longer operating
        histories and greater financial and other resources\\nthan the company. our
        competitors include but are not limited to baja carports, solaire, visole
        energy, and wattlotts. these companies,\\namong others, compete with us in
        the business of designing, assembling, selling, and installing solar power
        production facilities\\nfor parking lots and parking structures. while we
        believe that our proprietary designs and our deployment strategies differentiate\\nus
        from our competitors in the market, there is no assurance that our business,
        operating results, and financial condition will\\nnot be materially adversely
        affected by our competitors.\\n\u00a0\\ngovernment regulation\\n\u00a0\\nbusinesses
        in general\\nand solar energy companies in particular are subject to extensive
        regulation at the federal, state, and local level. we are subject\\nto extensive
        government regulation of employment, health, safety, working conditions, labor
        relations, and the environment in the\\ncourse of the conduct of our business.
        in order for our customers to enable the installation of our equipment and
        to utilize our\\nproducts, they generally are required to obtain permits from
        local and other governmental agencies. in order to access the utility\\ngrid
        for the solar power produced by our products, they must comply with the applicable
        rules and regulations of the relevant state\\npublic utility agencies. in

        adverse effect on our ability to continue to deploy our next-generation\\nsatellites
        and related infrastructure, products and services.  in addition, there can
        be no assurance that our internally\\ngenerated cash flows will meet our current
        expectations or that we will not encounter increased costs. among other factors
        leading to the uncertainty, including those over our internally generated
        cash flows is the future demand for our products and\\nservices of our newly
        acquired businesses may be lower than our expectations. if available funds
        from borrowings and internally generated cash flows are less than we expect,
        our ability to maintain our network, design, build and launch our\\nnext-generation
        satellites and related ground infrastructure, develop new products and services,
        and pursue additional growth opportunities may be impaired, which could significantly
        limit the development of our business and impair our ability to\\nprovide
        a commercially acceptable level of service.  the $45 million 9.5% senior notes
        that we issued on january\u00a04,\\n2013 could restrict our business activities
        or our ability to execute our strategic objectives or adversely affect our
        financial performance.  on january\u00a04, 2013, we issued $45 million aggregate
        principal amount of 9.5% senior notes (the \u0093senior notes\u0094). the
        senior notes contain covenants that may restrict our business activities\\nor
        our ability to execute our \\n\u00a0 29 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\n\\nstrategic
        objectives, and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in
        a default under our indebtedness. our inability to generate sufficient cash
        flow to satisfy interest payments\\nand principal repayment at maturity, could
        adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  the\\ncovenants
        in the senior notes limits our ability to among other things to, incur additional
        indebtedness and liens, to sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of our
        or subsidiaries assets, merge or consolidate with other companies. we must
        also\\ncomply with a maintenance covenant of either having available liquidity
        or exceed a specific leverage ratio. we are also required to obtain launch
        and one year in-orbit insurance for our next-generation satellites under the
        terms of the senior\\nnotes. failure to comply with the covenants could result
        in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, the lenders may require
        repayment in full of all principal and interest outstanding. if we fail to
        repay such amounts, the lenders may\\nforeclose on substantially all of our
        assets which we have pledged. if we unable to cure the default, we may need
        to repay the debt and find other sources of financing and there can be no
        assurance that we would have access to other sources of\\nfinancing on acceptable
        terms, or at all.  we incur significant costs as a result of operating as
        a public company, and\\nour management devotes substantial time to compliance
        requirements.  we incur significant legal, accounting and other\\nexpenses
        as a public company, including costs resulting from regulations regarding
        corporate governance practices. for example, the listing requirements of the
        nasdaq global market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance
        requirements\\nrelating to independent directors, audit committees, distribution
        of annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, stockholder approvals,
        solicitation of proxies, conflicts of interest, stockholder voting rights
        and codes of conduct. our\\nmanagement and other personnel devote a substantial
        amount of time to these compliance requirements. moreover, these rules and
        regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will
        make some activities more time-consuming and\\ncostly. further, these rules
        and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain
        qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees
        or as executive officers. \\nif end-users do not accept our services and the
        applications developed by vars and us, or we cannot obtain or maintain the\\nnecessary
        regulatory approvals or licenses for particular countries or territories,
        we will fail to attract new customers and our business will be harmed.  our
        success depends on end-users accepting our services, the applications developed
        by vars and us, and a number of other factors, including the technical capabilities
        of our system, the availability of\\nlow cost subscriber communicators, the
        receipt and maintenance of regulatory and other approvals in the united states
        and other countries and territories in which we operate, the price of our
        services and the extent and availability of competitive\\nor alternative services.
        we may not succeed in increasing revenue from the sale of our products and
        services to new and existing customers. our failure to significantly increase
        the number of end-users will harm our business. \\nour business plan assumes
        that potential customers and end-users will accept certain limitations inherent
        in our satellite communications\\nsystem. for example, our satellite system
        is optimized for small packet, or narrowband, data transmissions, is subject
        to certain delays in the relay of messages, referred to as latencies, and
        may be subject to certain line-of-sight limitations\\nbetween our satellites
        and the end-user\u0092s subscriber communicator. in addition, our satellite
        system is not capable of handling voice traffic. certain potential end-users,
        particularly those requiring full time, real-time communications and\\nthose
        requiring the transmission of large amounts of data or voice traffic, may
        find such limitations unacceptable. furthermore, current satellite-based ais
        signal reception systems may not receive all ais transmission signals on ais
        equipped\\nvessels in a given day due to signal collisions and co-channel
        interference of ais transmissions, particularly in areas with a high density
        of ais equipped vessels such as ports. \\nin addition to the limitations imposed
        by the architecture of our satellite communications system, our failure to
        obtain the necessary\\nregulatory and other approvals or licenses in a given
        country or territory will preclude the availability of our services in such
        country or territory until such time, if at all, that such approvals or licenses
        can be obtained. certain potential\\nend-users requiring messaging services
        in those countries and territories may find such limitations unacceptable.
        \\n\u00a0 30 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\nwe face competition from existing
        and potential competitors in the telecommunications\\nindustry, including
        numerous terrestrial and satellite-based network systems with greater resources,

        with respect to satellite low speed data service. in addition, a continuing
        trend toward consolidation and strategic alliances in the telecommunications
        industry could give rise to significant new competitors, and foreign competitors\\nmay
        benefit from government subsidies, or other protective measures, afforded
        by their home countries. some of these competitors may provide more efficient
        or less expensive services than we are able to provide, which could reduce
        our market share\\nand adversely affect our revenues and business.  many of
        our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater\\nfinancial,
        technical, marketing and distribution resources than we do. additionally,

        end-user solutions. these factors make it difficult to evaluate your investment
        in us.  since\\nmid-2011 we have expanded our business with technologies purchased
        from acquisitions. our prospects and ability to implement our current business

        and distribute our ais services. the willingness of our\\nexisting resellers,
        as well as potential new resellers, to engage or continue to engage in our
        business depends on a number of factors, including whether they perceive our
        services to be compatible with their business objectives, whether they\\nbelieve
        we will successfully deploy our next-generation satellites, whether the prices
        they can charge end-users will provide an adequate return, and regulatory
        constraints, if any. we believe that successful marketing of our services
        will depend on\\nthe design, development and commercial availability of applications
        that support the specific needs of the targeted end-users. the design, development
        and implementation of applications require the commitment of substantial financial
        and\\ntechnological resources on the part of these resellers and our subsidiaries.
        certain resellers are, and many potential resellers will be, newly formed
        or small ventures with limited financial resources, and such entities might
        not be successful in\\ntheir efforts to design applications or effectively
        market our services. the inability of these resellers to provide applications
        to end-users could have a harmful effect on our business, financial condition
        and results of operations. we also\\nbelieve that our success depends upon
        the pricing of applications by our resellers to end-users, over which we have
        no control other than with respect to our subsidiaries.  as a result of these
        arrangements, we are dependent on the performance of our resellers to generate
        substantially all our service revenues. if our resellers fail to market or
        distribute our services\\neffectively, our revenues, profitability, liquidity
        and reputation could be adversely affected.  defects or errors in\\napplications
        could result in end-users not being able to use our services, which would
        damage our reputation and harm our financial condition.  our resellers must
        develop applications quickly to keep pace with rapidly changing markets. these
        applications, as well as new models of subscriber communicators, have long
        development cycles and may\\n\\n\u00a0 32 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\n\\ncontain
        undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when subsequent
        versions are introduced, which could result in the disruption of our services
        to the end-users. such\\ndisruption could damage our reputation as well as
        the reputation of the respective resellers, and result in lost customers,
        lost revenue, diverted development resources, and increased service and warranty
        costs. \\nbecause we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial
        portion of our revenues, the loss or decline or slowdown in\\ngrowth in business
        in any of these customers could seriously harm our business.  significant
        customers such as\\ncaterpillar, komatsu and hitachi, collectively, represented
        35.9% and 44.4% of our revenues in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are expected
        to represent a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future. as
        a result, the loss of any one of\\nthese customers, or decline or slowdown
        in the growth in business of these customers, which could occur at any time,
        could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
        and results of operations. in addition, because service\\nrevenue depends
        either partially or entirely on the usage of our products and services by
        our customers and end users, the decline or slowdown in the growth of usage
        patterns of these customers which could occur at any time and with or without
        a\\nreduction in the number of our billable subscribers could have a material
        adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  if
        our international licensees and country representatives are not successful
        in establishing their businesses outside of the united states, the prospects
        for our business will be limited.\\n outside of the united states, we rely
        in part on international licensees and country representatives to establish\\nbusinesses
        in their respective territories, including obtaining and maintaining necessary
        regulatory and other approvals as well as managing local vars. international
        licensees and country representatives may not be successful in obtaining and\\nmaintaining
        the necessary regulatory and other approvals to provide our services in their
        assigned territories and, even if those approvals are obtained and maintained,
        international licensees and/or country representatives may not be successful
        in\\ndeveloping a market and/or distribution network within their territories.
        certain of the international licensees and/or country representatives are,
        or are likely to be, newly formed or small ventures with limited or no operational
        history and\\nlimited financial resources, and any such entities may not be
        successful in their efforts to secure adequate financing and to continue operating.
        in addition, in certain countries and territories outside the united states,
        we rely on international\\nlicensees and country representatives to operate
        and maintain various components of our system, such as gateway earth stations.
        these international licensees and country representatives may not be successful
        in operating and maintaining such\\ncomponents of our communications system
        and may not have the same financial incentives as we do to maintain those
        components in good repair.  some of our international licensees and country
        representatives are experiencing significant operational and financial difficulties
        and have in the past defaulted on their obligations to us.\\n some of our
        international licensees and country representatives were also international
        licensees and country\\nrepresentatives of our predecessor company and, as
        a consequence of the bankruptcy of orbcomm global l.p., they were left in
        many cases with significant financial problems, including significant debt
        and insufficient working capital. certain of our\\ninternational licensees
        and country representatives (including in morocco, malaysia, brazil, and kazakhstan)
        have continued to experience significant material difficulties, including
        underperforming local sales and marketing efforts and the failure\\nto pay
        us for our services. to date, several of our licensees and country representatives
        have had difficulty in paying their usage fees and have not paid us or have
        paid us at reduced rates and in cases where collectability is not reasonably\\nassured,
        we have not reflected invoices issued to such licensees and country representatives
        in our revenues or accounts receivable. the ability of these international
        licensees and country representatives to pay their obligations to us may be\\ndependent,
        in many cases, upon their ability to successfully restructure their business
        and operations or raise additional capital. in addition, we have from time
        to time had disagreements with certain of our international licensees related
        to these\\noperational and financial difficulties. to the extent these international
        licensees and \\n\u00a0 33 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\n\\ncountry representatives
        are unable to reorganize and/or raise additional capital to execute their
        business plans on favorable terms (or are delayed in doing so), our ability
        to offer services\\ninternationally and recognize revenue will be impaired
        and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely
        affected.  as a result of these difficulties experienced by our international
        licensees, we have and expect to continue to acquire their operations or gateway
        earth stations and, where permissible, seek to maintain\\ncontrol of international
        licensees through majority ownership. although we have implemented a strategy
        for the acquisition of certain independent licensees and gateway earth station
        operators when circumstances permit, we may not be able to continue\\nto implement
        this strategy on favorable terms and may not be able to realize the additional
        efficiencies that we anticipate from this strategy. in some regions it is
        impracticable to acquire the independent gateway earth station operators either\\nbecause
        local regulatory requirements or business norms do not permit an acquisition,
        because the expected revenue increase from an acquisition would be insufficient
        to justify the transaction, or because the independent gateway earth station\\noperator
        will not sell at a price acceptable to us. in those regions, our revenue and
        profits may be adversely affected if those independent gateway earth station
        operators do not fulfill their own business plans to increase substantially
        their\\nsales of services and products.  while expanding our international
        operations would advance our growth, it would also increase\\nnumerous risks,
        including:  \u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u0095\\n\u00a0\\n difficulties in penetrating
        new markets due to established and entrenched competitors; \\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u0095\\n\u00a0\\n
        difficulties in developing products and services that are tailored to the
        needs of local customers; \\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u0095\\n\u00a0\\n lack
        of local acceptance or knowledge of our products and services; \\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u0095\\n\u00a0\\n
        lack of recognition of our products and services;  \u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u0095\\n\u00a0\\n

        \\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u0095\\n\u00a0\\n significant investments, including
        the development, deployment and maintenance of dedicated gateway earth stations
        or other ground infrastructure as\\ncertain countries require physical gateways
        within their jurisdiction to connect the traffic coming to and from their
        territory;  \u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u0095\\n\u00a0\\n instability of international

        \\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u0095\\n\u00a0\\n foreign currency exchange rates
        and exchange controls.  these risks could affect our ability to successfully
        compete and expand internationally. the prices for most of our products and
        services are denominated in u.s.\u00a0dollars. any appreciation of the\\nu.s.\u00a0dollar
        against other currencies will increase the cost of our products and services
        to our international customers and, as a result, may reduce the competitiveness
        of our international offerings and make it more difficult for us to grow\\ninternationally.  we
        currently are unable to offer \u0093near-real-time\u0094 service in important
        regions of the world\\ndue to the absence of gateway earth stations in those
        areas, and satellite coverage issues, which is limiting our growth and our
        ability to compete.  our objective is to establish a worldwide service network,
        either directly or through independent gateway operators, but to date we have
        been unable to do so in certain areas of the world and we may not\\nsucceed
        in doing \\n\u00a0 34 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\n\\nso in the future. we
        have been unable to find capable independent gateway operators or otherwise
        obtain regulatory authorizations to install and operate gateway earth stations
        for several\\nimportant regions and countries, including china, india, russia
        and certain parts of southeast asia. gaps in our satellite coverage exist
        and will continue until we launch additional satellites. this could reduce
        overall demand for our products and\\nservices and reduce the value of our
        services for potential users who require service in these areas.  a natural\\ndisaster
        could diminish our ability to provide communications service.  natural disasters
        could damage or destroy our\\ngateway earth stations or our other ground-based
        facilities resulting in a disruption of service to our customers in the affected
        region. in addition, the collateral effects of such natural disasters could
        impair the functioning of our ground\\nequipment. if a natural disaster were
        to impair or destroy any of our ground facilities, we might be unable to provide
        service to our customers in the affected area for a period of time. even if
        the gateway earth stations are not affected by natural\\ndisasters, our service
        could be disrupted if a natural disaster damages wireline or terrestrial wireless
        networks that we utilize, or disrupts our ability to connect to those networks.
        such failure or service disruptions could harm our business and\\nresults
        of operations.  we rely on a limited number of manufacturers for our subscriber
        communicators. if we are unable\\nto, or cannot find third parties to, manufacture
        a sufficient quantity of subscriber communicators at a reasonable price, the
        prospects for our business will be negatively impacted. \\nthe development
        and availability on a timely basis of relatively inexpensive subscriber communicators
        are critical to the successful\\ncommercial operation of our system. our subsidiaries
        rely on contract manufacturers to produce subscriber communicators. our japan
        subsidiary mainly relies on quake global, inc. (\u0093quake\u0094) as its
        contract manufacturer for subscriber\\ncommunicators, and our logistics management
        solutions subsidiaries relies on a few contract manufacturers for subscriber
        communicators. our customers may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply
        of subscriber communicators at price points or with\\nfunctional characteristics
        and reliability that meet their needs. an inability to successfully develop
        and manufacture subscriber communicators that meet the needs of customers
        and are available in sufficient numbers and at prices that render our\\nservices
        cost-effective to customers could limit the acceptance of our system and potentially
        affect the quality of our services, which could have a material adverse effect
        on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\nour business
        may be materially and adversely affected if our subsidiaries\u0092 relationship
        with these contract manufacturers is\\nterminated or modified. if our arrangements
        with third party manufacturers are terminated our search for additional or
        alternate manufacturers could result in significant delays, added expense
        and an inability to maintain or expand our customer\\nbase. any of these events
        could require us to take unforeseen actions or devote additional resources
        to provide our services and could harm our ability to compete effectively.  if
        our arrangements with third party manufacturers are terminated or expire,
        our search for additional or alternate manufacturers could result in significant
        delays in customers activating subscriber\\ncommunicators on our communications
        system, added expense for our customers and our inability to maintain or expand
        our customer base.  we depend on recruiting and retaining qualified personnel
        and our inability to do so would seriously harm our business. \\nbecause of
        the technical nature of our services and the market in which we compete, our
        success depends on the continued services of our\\nkey personnel, including
        certain of our engineering personnel, and our ability to attract and retain
        qualified personnel. the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees
        or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified\\npersonnel could
        have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and
        our financial condition and results of operations. we do not have key-man
        life insurance policies covering any of our executive officers or key technical\\npersonnel.
        competitors and others have in the past, and may in the future, attempt to
        recruit our employees. the available pool of individuals with relevant \\n\u00a0
        35 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\n\\nexperience in the satellite and telematics
        industries is limited, and the process of identifying and recruiting personnel
        with the skills necessary to operate our system and our startrak\\napplications
        services can be lengthy and expensive. in addition, new employees generally
        require substantial training, which requires significant resources and management
        attention. even if we invest significant resources to recruit, train and\\nretain
        qualified personnel, we may not be successful in our efforts.  pursuing strategic
        transactions may cause us to\\nincur additional risks.  we may pursue additional
        acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic transactions on an\\nopportunistic
        basis. we may face costs and risks arising from any such transactions, including
        integrating a new business into our business or managing a joint venture.
        these risks may include legal, organizational, financial, loss of key customers\\nand
        distributors and diversion of management\u0092s time.  in addition, if we
        were to choose to engage in any major business\\ncombination or similar strategic
        transaction, we may require or cause us to seek significant external financing
        in connection with the transaction. depending on market conditions, investor
        perceptions of our company and other factors, we may not be\\nable to obtain
        capital on acceptable terms, in acceptable amounts or at appropriate times
        to implement any such transaction. any such financing, if obtained, may further
        dilute existing stockholders. \\nwe may be subject to litigation proceedings
        that could adversely affect our business. \\nwe may be subject to legal claims
        or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, antitrust, intellectual
        property infringement and\\nother issues. litigation is subject to inherent
        uncertainties, including increases in demands for attention on our management
        team, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include
        money damages. if an unfavorable ruling were\\nto occur, it could have a material
        adverse effect on our business and results of operations for the period in
        which the ruling occurred or future periods.  our business is characterized
        by rapid technological change and we may not be able to compete with new and
        emerging technologies. \\nwe operate in the telecommunications and telematics
        industries, which are characterized by extensive research and development
        efforts and\\nrapid technological change. new and advanced technology which
        can perform essentially the same functions as our messaging and products and
        services, such as digital cellular networks (gsm, 3g, 4g and lte), direct
        broadcast satellites, new deployed\\nsatellites of competing low-earth orbit
        satellite systems and other forms of wireless transmission, are in various
        stages of development by others in the industry. the telematics industry includes
        numerous companies developing technologies to\\ncompete with the products
        and services of our subsidiaries. these technologies are being developed,
        supported and rolled out by entities that may have significantly greater resources
        than we do. these technologies could adversely impact the demand\\nfor our
        products and services. research and development by others may lead to technologies
        that render some or all of our services non-competitive or obsolete in the
        future.  because we operate our telecommunications services in a highly regulated
        industry, we may be subjected to increased regulatory restrictions which could
        disrupt our service or increase our operating\\ncosts.  system operators and
        service providers are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of various
        countries\\nand the rules and policies they adopt. these rules and policies,
        among other things, establish technical parameters for the operation of facilities
        and subscriber communicators, determine the permissible uses of facilities
        and subscriber\\ncommunicators, and establish the terms and conditions pursuant
        to which our international licensees and country representatives operate their
        facilities, including certain of the gateway earth stations and gateway control
        centers in our system.\\nthese rules and policies may also require our international
        licensees and country representatives to disrupt the data passing through
        the gateway earth stations or gateway \\n\u00a0 36 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\n\\ncontrol
        centers without notifying us or our end-users, significantly disrupting the
        operation of our communications system. these rules and policies may also
        impose regulatory constraints on the\\nuse of subscriber communicators within
        certain countries or territories. international and domestic licensing and
        certification requirements may cause a delay in the marketing of our services
        and products, may impose costly fees and procedures on\\nour international
        licensees and country representatives, and may give a competitive advantage
        to larger companies that compete with our international licensees and country
        representatives. possible future changes to regulations and policies in the\\ncountries
        in which we operate may result in additional regulatory requirements or restrictions
        on the services and equipment we provide, which may have a material adverse
        effect on our business and operations. although we believe that we or our\\ninternational
        licensees and country representatives have obtained all the licenses required
        to conduct our business as it is operated today, we may not be able to obtain,
        modify or maintain such licenses in the future. moreover, changes in\\ninternational
        or domestic licensing and certification requirements may result in disruptions
        of our communications services or alternatively result in added operational
        costs, which could harm our business. our use of certain orbital planes and\\nradio
        frequency assignments, as licensed by the fcc, is subject to the frequency
        coordination and registration process of the itu. in the event disputes arise
        during coordination, the itu\u0092s radio regulations do not contain mandatory
        dispute\\nresolution or enforcement mechanisms and neither the itu specifically,
        nor does international law generally, provide clear remedies in this situation.
        finally, our business could be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws,
        fees, policies or\\nregulations, or changes in the interpretation or application
        of existing laws, fees, policies and regulations that modify the present regulatory
        environment, including with respect to prohibiting or limiting the distribution
        of real or\\nnear-real-time ais data.  our telecommunications business relies
        on our ability to maintain our fcc licenses.\\n our fcc licenses\u00a0\u0097
        the space segment license, and separate licenses for the four u.s.\u00a0gateway
        earth\\nstations and a blanket license for the subscriber communicators\u00a0\u0097
        are subject to revocation if we fail to satisfy certain conditions or to meet
        certain prescribed milestones. our fcc space segment license is valid until
        april 2025 and\\nauthorizes the continued operation of the first generation
        orbcomm satellites, the construction, launch and operation of the orbcomm
        next-generation satellites, as well any required construction, launch and
        operation during the term of the license\\nof additional technically identical
        replacement satellites.  the u.s.\u00a0gateway earth station and subscriber
        communicator\\nlicenses will expire in 2020. our fcc space segment license
        renewal application must be filed between 30 and 90 days prior to april 2022,
        and our renewal applications for the gateway earth station and subscriber
        communicator licenses must be filed\\nbetween 30 and 90\u00a0days prior to
        expiration. although the fcc has been positively disposed thus far towards
        granting our applications for license renewals, there can be no assurance
        that the fcc will in fact renew our fcc licenses in the future.\\n our current
        fcc space segment license authorizes the continuing operation of the first

        the orbcomm next-generation satellites, and any required construction, launch
        and operation during the term of the license of additional technically identical
        replacement satellites. based on changed\\ncircumstances relating, among other
        things, to launch vehicle availability, we have an application pending before
        the fcc to modify our space segment license to accommodate revisions to our
        next-generation satellite deployment plan for the remaining\\nseventeen next-generation
        satellites that snc is currently producing.  we believe that our satellite
        system is currently in\\nfull compliance with all applicable fcc rules, policies,
        and license conditions. we also believe that we will continue to be able to
        comply with all applicable fcc requirements, but we cannot assure you that
        it will be the case. although the fcc has\\nbeen positively disposed thus
        far towards granting our applications for license modifications and renewals,
        there can be no assurance that the fcc will in fact grant our currently pending
        application to modify our space segment license to\\naccommodate our revised
        next-generation satellite deployment plan. additionally, there can be no assurance
        that, to the extent that any modification of our fcc licenses may be required
        in the future to address changed\\n\\n\u00a0 37 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\n\\ncircumstances,
        that any related fcc applications we may file will be granted on a timely

        to renew one or more of our fcc licenses, any such circumstance could have
        a material adverse impact on our business including\\nthe possible delay of

        affected by the adoption of new laws, policies or regulations, or changes
        in the interpretation or application of existing laws, policies and\\nregulations
        that modify the present regulatory environment.  our business would be harmed
        if our international licensees\\nand country representatives fail to acquire
        and retain all necessary regulatory approvals; we are currently unable to
        offer service in important regions of the world due to regulatory requirements,
        which is limiting our growth and our ability to\\ncompete.  our business is
        affected by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which we operate.
        due to foreign\\nownership restrictions in various jurisdictions around the
        world, obtaining and maintaining local regulatory approval for operation of
        our system is the responsibility of our international licensees and/or country
        representatives in each of these\\nlicensed territories. in addition, in certain
        countries regulatory frameworks may be rudimentary or in an early stage of
        development, which can make it difficult or impossible to license and operate
        our system in such jurisdictions. there can be no\\nassurance that our international
        licensees, our country representatives and/or us will be successful in obtaining
        or maintaining any additional approvals that may be desirable and, if these
        efforts are not successful, we will be unable to provide\\nservice in such
        countries. our inability to offer service in one or more important new markets,
        particularly in china or india, could have a negative impact on our ability
        to generate more revenue and could diminish our business prospects.\\n our
        ability to provide service in certain regions is limited by local regulations
        as some countries, like china, india and\\nrussia, have specific regulatory
        requirements such as local domestic ownership requirements or requirements
        for physical gateway earth stations or other ground infrastructure within
        their jurisdiction to connect traffic coming to and from their\\nterritory.
        while we are currently in discussions with parties in these countries to satisfy
        these regulatory requirements, we may not be able find an acceptable local
        partner or reach an agreement to develop additional gateway earth stations
        or\\nother ground infrastructure or the cost of developing and deploying such
        infrastructure may be prohibitive, which could impair our ability to expand
        our product and service offerings in such areas and undermine our value for
        potential users who\\nrequire service in these areas. the inability to offer
        to sell our products and services in all major international markets could
        impair our international growth. in addition, the construction of such gateway
        earth stations or other ground\\ninfrastructure in foreign countries may require
        us to comply with certain u.s.\u00a0regulatory requirements which may contravene
        the laws or regulations of the local jurisdiction. \\nthere are numerous risks
        inherent to our international operations that are beyond our control. \\ninternational

        which may make payment in u.s.\u00a0dollars more expensive for foreign\\ncustomers
        or payment in foreign currencies less valuable for us. certain of these risks
        may be greater in developing countries or regions, where economic, political

        maintain in-orbit or other\\ninsurance for our satellites.  we do not currently
        maintain in-orbit insurance coverage for our satellites to address\\nthe risk
        of potential systemic anomalies, failures or catastrophic events affecting
        the existing satellite constellation. \\n\u00a0 38 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\nwe
        are required to obtain launch and one year in-orbit insurance for our next-generation\\nsatellites
        under the terms of the senior notes. however, our ability to procure such
        insurance will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of
        insurance in the market and the cost of available insurance. we may not be
        able to\\nobtain insurance at reasonable costs. even if we obtain insurance,
        it may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses we may suffer due
        to applicable deductions and exclusions. furthermore, launch insurance does
        not cover lost revenue.\\n the price, terms and availability of insurance
        have fluctuated significantly since we began offering commercial satellite\\nservices.
        the cost of obtaining insurance can vary as a result of either satellite failures
        or general conditions in the insurance industry. insurance policies on satellites
        may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at\\nall.
        in addition to higher premiums, insurance policies may provide for higher
        deductibles, shorter coverage periods and additional satellite health-related
        policy exclusions. an uninsured failure of one or more of our satellites could
        have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
        operations. in addition, higher premiums on insurance policies would increase
        our costs, thereby reducing our operating income by the amount of such increased
        premiums. moreover, if\\nwe were to determine in the future that the terms
        of any particular insurance is economically unfavorable or unfeasible after
        taking into account factors such as cost of the insurance and scope of insurance
        exclusions and limitations, we may elect\\nto self-insure against losses of
        such satellites.  even where we obtain in-orbit insurance for a satellite,
        this insurance\\ncoverage will not protect us against all losses that might
        arise as a result of a satellite failure. any future policies can be expected
        to contain specified exclusions and material change limitations customary
        in the industry at the time the policy\\nis written. these exclusions typically
        relate to losses resulting from acts of war, insurrection or military action,
        government confiscation, as well as lasers, directed energy beams, or nuclear
        or anti-satellite devices or radioactive\\ncontamination.  in addition, should
        we wish to launch a spare satellite to replace a failed operational satellite,
        the timing\\nof such launch will be dependent on prior commitments made by
        potential suppliers of launch services to other satellite operators. our insurance
        does not protect us against lost or delayed revenue, business interruption
        or lost business\\nopportunities. we do not maintain third-party liability
        insurance with respect to our satellites. accordingly, we have no insurance
        to cover any third-party damages that may be caused by any of our satellites.
        if we experience significant uninsured\\nlosses, such events could have a
        material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
        operations. \\nour business relies on intellectual property, some of which
        third parties own and we or our customers may inadvertently infringe\\nupon
        their patents and proprietary rights.  many entities, including some of our
        competitors, currently (or may in the\\nfuture) hold patents and other intellectual
        property rights that cover or affect products or services related to those
        that we or our customers offer. we cannot assure you that we are aware of
        all intellectual property rights that our products or\\nthat of our customers

        of our products or that of our customers infringes upon intellectual property
        held by others, we or our customers may be required to cease developing\\nor
        marketing those products, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual
        property, or to redesign those products in such a way as to avoid infringing
        upon others\u0092 patents. we cannot estimate the extent to which we or our
        customers\\nmay be required in the future to obtain intellectual property
        licenses, or the availability and cost of any such licenses. to the extent
        that we are required to pay royalties to third parties to whom we are not
        currently making payments, these\\nincreased costs of doing business could
        negatively affect our profitability or liquidity.  if a competitor holds intellectual\\nproperty

        however, our position is subject to review and possible challenge by the taxing
        authorities of these jurisdictions. if the applicable taxing authorities were

        \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\nrisks related to our technology \\nnew satellites
        are subject to launch failures, delays and cost overruns, the occurrence of
        which can materially and adversely affect\\nour operations and business.  satellites
        are subject to inherent risks related to failed or delayed launches and cost\\noverruns.
        cost overruns can be caused by a number of factors. launch failures result
        in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need
        both to construct replacement satellites, and to obtain other launch opportunities.
        we\\nexpect replacement satellites and new launch services to cost significantly
        more. launch delays can be caused by a number of factors, including delays
        in manufacturing satellites, preparing satellites for launch, securing appropriate
        launch vehicles\\nor obtaining regulatory approvals. we intend to conduct
        various satellite launches for our next-generation satellites to augment the
        existing constellation in order to expand the messaging capacity of our network
        and improve the service level of our\\nnetwork. any launch delays, or launch
        failures of our additional satellites could result in significant delays from
        the date of the launch failure until additional satellites under construction
        are completed and their launches are achieved. such\\ndelays and cost overruns
        would have a negative impact on our future growth and would materially and
        adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
        \\nour satellites have a limited operating life; all of our recently launched
        satellites have failed and others have degraded over\\ntime resulting in increased
        system latencies. if we are unable to deploy replacement satellites in a timely
        manner, our services will be harmed and materially adversely affect our operations
        and business. \\nour first-generation satellites were generally placed into
        orbit between 1997 and 1999 and have through certain operational and software\\nupdates
        exceeded their average expected operating life of approximately nine to twelve
        years. on june\u00a019, 2008, we launched five of the six quick-launch satellites
        together with our ais demonstration unit in a single mission to supplement
        and\\nultimately replace our existing plane a satellites. in addition to supplementing
        and replacing our first-generation satellites, these satellites were also
        intended to expand the capacity of our communications system. during 2008
        and 2009, the ais\\ndemonstration unit and three quick-launch satellites failed,
        and in 2010, the remaining two quick-launch satellites failed. in october
        2012, a next-generation prototype satellite was deployed into a lower orbit
        as the result of a pre-imposed safety\\ncheck required by nasa that caused
        the satellite to de-orbit in just over fifty hours from launch. the safety
        check was designed to protect the international space station and its crew.
        we consider a satellite \u0093failed\u0094 only when it can no\\nlonger provide
        any communications service, and we do not intend to undertake further efforts
        to return it to service. our plans to extend the operating life of our network
        are dependent on the health of our satellites and the failure of the ais\\ndemonstration
        unit, og2 prototype and the quick-launch satellites could eventually have
        a significant impact on the operating life of our network. these satellite
        failures combined with the aging of our first generation satellites have resulted
        in\\nincreased system latencies, which have resulted and may continue to result
        in our customers or potential customers delaying deployments or using a competing
        wireless data network. \\nwhile we expect that our current constellation to
        provide a commercially acceptable level of satellite messaging service through
        the\\nscheduled launch of our next-generation satellites, we cannot guarantee
        we will be able to provide such level of service through such launches of
        our next-generation satellites. also, our satellites have already exceeded
        their original design lives\\nand although actual design life typically exceeds
        original design life the actual remaining useful lives of our satellites may
        be shorter than we expect. if we are unable to effectively develop and deploy
        our next-generation satellites before our\\ncurrent constellation ceases to
        provide a commercially acceptable level of service, for any reason, including
        as a result of insufficient funds, manufacturing or launch delays, launch
        failures, in-orbit satellite failures, inability to achieve or\\nmaintain
        orbital placement, failure of the satellites to perform as expected or delays
        in receiving regulatory approvals, or if we experience backward compatibility
        problems with our new constellation once deployed, we will likely lose customers
        and\\nbusiness opportunities to our competitors, resulting in a material decline
        in revenues and profitability as our ability to provide a commercially acceptable
        level of service is impaired. in addition, because we acquired a fully operational
        satellite\\nconstellation and communications system from orbcomm global l.p.
        and its subsidiaries, our current senior management team has limited experience
        with managing the design, construction, launch, and in-orbit testing and deployment
        of a satellite\\nsystem. \\n\u00a0 41 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\nwe are
        dependent on a limited number of suppliers to provide the payload, bus and\\nlaunch
        vehicle for our next-generation satellites and any increased cost, delay or
        disruption in the supply of these components and related services will adversely
        affect our ability to replenish our satellite constellation and adversely
        impact our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.  in
        2008, we entered into an agreement with snc to design and\\nmanufacture 18
        next-generation satellites. snc has limited experience in acting as prime
        contractor for complete satellite systems and has experienced significant
        delays in completing the next-generation satellites from the original completion\\nschedule.
        in 2009, we entered into a commercial launch services agreement with spacex
        to provide launch services using multiple spacex falcon 1e launch vehicles
        for the carriage into low-earth orbit of our next-generation satellites being\\nconstructed
        by snc. in december, 2012 we entered into new agreements with spacex where
        the satellites will be launched using an upgraded falcon 9 launch vehicle
        that is currently under development instead of the falcon 1e. spacex has a
        limited\\noperating history and undetermined financial resources as a privately
        held company. while\u00a0the falcon 9 rocket has now flown a number of successful
        missions, spacex has employed a new version of the falcon 9 launcher with
        several modifications.\\nour reliance on these suppliers for their services
        involves significant risks and uncertainties, including whether our suppliers
        will provide an adequate supply of required components of sufficient quality,
        will charge the agreed upon prices or will\\nperform their obligations on
        a timely basis. if any of our suppliers becomes financially unstable, we may
        have to find a new supplier. there are a limited number of suppliers for communication
        satellite components and related services and the\\nlead-time required to
        qualify a new supplier may take several months. there are only a limited number
        of suppliers to launch our satellites. there is no assurance that a new supplier
        will be found on a timely basis, or at all, if any one of our\\nsuppliers
        ceases to supply their services for our satellites or cease to provide launch
        services.  any delay or continuing\\ndelays in our launch schedule could adversely
        affect our ability to provide communications services, particularly as the
        health of our current satellite constellation declines, and we could lose
        current or prospective customers as a result of\\nservice interruptions. the
        loss of any of our suppliers or delay in our launch schedule or any significant
        increase in costs in our next-generation satellite program could have a material
        adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.  once
        launched and properly deployed, our satellites are subject to significant
        operating risks\\ndue to various types of potential anomalies.  satellites
        utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh\\nenvironment of
        space and, accordingly, are subject to significant operational risks while
        in orbit. these risks include malfunctions, or \u0093anomalies\u0094, that

        of the satellite, degraded communications performance, reduced power available
        to the satellite in sunlight and/or eclipse, battery overcharging or undercharging
        and limitations on satellite\\ncommunications capacity. some of these effects
        may be increased during periods of greater message traffic and could result
        in our system requiring more than one attempt to send messages before they
        get through to our satellites. although these\\neffects do not result in lost
        messages, they could lead to increased messaging latencies for the end-user
        and reduced throughput for our system. see \u0093orbcomm communications system\u00a0\u0097

        products and services could fail to perform or perform at reduced levels of
        service because of technological malfunctions,\\nsatellite failures or deficiencies
        or events outside of our control, which would seriously harm our business
        and reputation.  our products and services are exposed to the risks inherent
        in a large-scale, complex telecommunications system employing advanced technology.
        any disruption to our services, information systems or\\ncommunication networks
        or those of third parties into which our network connects could result in
        the inability of our customers to receive our services for an indeterminate
        period of time. satellite anomalies and other technical and operational\\ndeficiencies
        of our communications system described in this annual report on form\u00a010-k
        could result in system failures or reduced levels of service. in addition,
        certain components of our system are located in foreign countries, and as
        a\\nresult, are potentially subject to governmental, regulatory or other actions
        in such countries which could force us to limit the operations of, or completely
        shut down, components of our system, including gateway earth stations or subscriber\\ncommunicators.
        any disruption to our services or extended periods of reduced levels of service
        could, and increased latencies in our satellite network delivering messages
        have and could continue to, cause us to lose customers or revenue, result
        in\\ndelays or cancellations of future implementations of our products and
        services, result in failure to attract customers or could result in litigation,
        customer service or repair work that would involve substantial costs and distract
        management from\\noperating our business. the failure of any of the diverse

        communicators, to function and coordinate as required could render our\\nsystem
        unable to perform at the quality and capacity levels required for success.
        any system failures, repeated product failures, shortened product life or
        extended reduced levels of service could reduce our sales, increase costs
        or result in\\nwarranty or liability claims and seriously harm our business.  all
        operational satellites are subject to the possibility\\nto be impacted by
        space debris or another spacecraft.  collisions with space debris or other
        spacecraft, could\\nmaterially affect system performance and our business.
        our satellites do not have the ability to actively maneuver to avoid potential
        impact by space debris or other satellites. on february\u00a010, 2009 a satellite
        owned by iridium satellite llc\\nand russia\u0092s cosmos collided in an orbital
        altitude similar to ours causing an increase in risk of space debris damaging
        or interfering with the operation of our satellites. \\nsome of the hardware
        and software we use in operating our gateway earth stations was designed and
        manufactured over ten years ago\\nand could be more difficult and expensive
        to service, upgrade or replace.  some of the hardware and software we use
        in\\noperating our gateway earth stations was designed and manufactured over
        ten years ago and portions are becoming obsolete. as they continue to age,
        they may become less reliable and will be more difficult and expensive to
        service, upgrade or replace.\\nalthough we maintain inventories of some spare
        parts, it nonetheless may be difficult or impossible to obtain all necessary
        replacement parts for the hardware. our business plan contemplates updating
        or replacing some of the hardware and software in\\nour network, however,
        the age of our existing hardware and software may present us with technical
        and operational challenges that complicate or otherwise make it not feasible
        to carry out our planned upgrades and replacements, and the expenditure of\\nresources,
        both from a monetary and human capital perspective, may exceed our estimates.
        without upgrading and replacing our equipment, obsolescence of the technologies
        that we use could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability\\nand
        liquidity.  technical or other difficulties with our gateway earth stations
        could harm our business.\\n our system relies in part on the functionality
        of our gateway earth stations, some of which are owned and maintained\\nby
        third parties. while we believe that the overall health of the majority of
        our gateway earth stations remains stable, we have and may continue to experience
        technical difficulties or parts obsolescence with our gateway earth stations
        which\\nnegatively impact service in the region covered by that gateway earth
        station. certain problems with these gateway earth stations have and may continue
        to reduce their availability and negatively impact the performance of our
        system in that region.\\nin addition, due to regulatory and licensing constraints
        in certain countries in which we operate, we are unable to wholly-own or majority-own
        some of the gateway earth stations in our system located outside the united
        states. as a result of these\\nownership restrictions, we rely on third parties
        to own and operate some of these gateway earth stations. if our relationship
        with these third parties deteriorates or if these third parties are unable
        or unwilling to bear the cost of operating or\\nmaintaining the gateway earth
        stations, or if there are changes in the applicable domestic regulations that
        require us to give up any or all of our ownership interests in any of the
        gateway earth stations, our control over our system could be\\ndiminished
        and our business could be harmed.  rapid and significant technological changes
        in the satellite\\ncommunications industry may impair our competitive position
        and require us to make significant additional capital expenditures.  the space
        and communications industries are subject to rapid advances and innovations
        in technology. we expect to face competition in the future from companies
        using new technologies and new satellite\\nsystems. new technology could render
        our system obsolete or less competitive by satisfying customer demand in more
        attractive ways or through the introduction of incompatible standards. particular
        technological developments that could adversely\\naffect us include the deployment
        by our competitors of new satellites with greater power, flexibility, efficiency
        or capabilities than our current constellation or our next generation satellites,
        as well as\\n\\n\u00a0 44 \\n\\n\\ntable of contents\\n\\ncontinuing improvements

        changes and remain competitive, we may need to make significant capital expenditures.
        customer\\nacceptance of the products and services that we offer will continually
        be affected by technology-based differences in our product and service offerings
        compared to those of our competitors. new technologies may be protected by
        patents or other\\nintellectual property laws and therefore may not be available
        to us. any failure by us to implement new technology within our system may
        compromise our ability to compete.  our networks and data processing systems
        and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security
        risks. \\nwe expect the secure transmission of confidential information over

        network and those of our third-party service providers and our customers may
        be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security
        problems. the data processing systems used to provide the telematics services
        of our\\nsubsidiaries may likewise be vulnerable. persons who circumvent security
        measures could wrongfully obtain or use information on the network or cause
        interruptions, delays or malfunctions in our operations, any of which could
        have a material adverse\\neffect on our business, financial condition and
        results of operations. we may be required to expend significant resources
        to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems,
        including reputational harm and litigation, caused\\nby any breaches. although
        we have implemented and intend to continue to implement security measures,
        these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and
        delays that could lower network operations center availability, which\\ncould
        harm our business.  the failure of our information technology systems could
        disrupt our business operations which\\ncould have a material adverse effect
        on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  the operation\\nof
        our business depends on its information technology systems. we rely on our
        information technology systems to effectively manage, among other things,
        our subsidiaries\u0092 customer interface as well as business data, communications,
        supply chain,\\ninventory management, customer order entry and order fulfillment,

        human resources benefits and payroll management, complying with regulatory,
        legal or tax requirements and\\nother processes and data necessary to manage
        our business. we use technology to provide secure transmission of confidential
        information, including our business data and customer information. to achieve
        our strategic objectives and to remain\\ncompetitive, we must continue to
        develop and enhance our information systems. this may require the acquisition
        of equipment and software and the development, either internally or through
        independent consultants, of new proprietary software. our\\ninability to design,
        develop, implement and utilize, in a cost-effective manner, information systems
        that provide the capabilities necessary for us to compete effectively, could
        make us less competitive, increase our costs and adversely affect our\\nbusiness.
        the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate
        could disrupt our business and could result in, among other things, transaction
        errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of data and the loss of sales and\\ncustomers,
        which could cause our business and results of operations to suffer. in addition,
        our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption
        from circumstances beyond our control, including, without limitation, fire,\\nnatural
        disasters, power outages, systems failure, system conversions, security breaches,
        cyber-attacks, viruses and/or human error. in any such event, we could be
        required to make a significant investment to fix or replace its information\\ntechnology
        systems, and we could experience interruptions in its ability to service our
        customers. any such damage or interruption could adversely effect on our business,
        financial condition and/or results of operations. \\nsecurity problems with
        our software products, systems or services, including the improper disclosure
        of data, could cause increased\\ncyber-security protections costs and general
        service costs, harm our reputation, and result in liability and increased
        expense for litigation and diversion of management time. \\nwe process large
        amounts of customer information. our software products also enable our customers
        to store and process data. we have\\nincluded security features in our products
        and processes that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of data,
        including confidential client data. security for our products and \\n\u00a0

        nature of the information contained in our systems. we also rely on employees
        in our network operations centers, data centers, and support operations\\nto
        follow our procedures when handling such information. it is possible that
        our security controls, our selection and training of employees, and other
        practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of information.
        any unauthorized\\naccess, computer viruses, accidental or intentional release
        of confidential information or other disruptions could result in increased
        costs, customer dissatisfaction leading to loss of customers and revenues,
        and fines and other liabilities. also,\\nsuch disclosure could harm our reputation
        and subject us to liability in regulatory proceedings and private litigation,
        resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. improper disclosure of corporate
        data could result in lawsuits or regulatory\\nproceedings alleging damages,
        and perceptions that our products and services do not adequately protect the
        privacy of customer data and could inhibit sales of our products and services.
        defending these types of claims could result in increased\\nexpenses for litigation
        and claims settlement and a significant diversion of our management\u0092s
        attention. additionally, our software products, the systems on which the products

        about our business, our stock price would likely decline. if one or more of
        these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports
        on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which\\ncould cause
        our stock price and trading volume to decline.  we are subject to anti-takeover
        provisions which could\\naffect the price of our common stock.  our amended
        and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain\\nprovisions
        that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent
        of our board of directors. these provisions do not permit actions by our stockholders
        by written consent and require the approval of the holders of at least\\n66
        2/3% of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote to amend certain provisions
        of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. in addition,
        these provisions include procedural requirements relating to stockholder meetings\\nand
        stockholder proposals that could make stockholder actions more difficult.
        our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors serving
        staggered, three-year terms and may be removed only for cause. any vacancy
        on the board of\\ndirectors may be filled only by the vote of the majority
        of directors then in office. our board of directors has the right to issue
        preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without stockholder
        approval, which could be used to\\ndilute the stock ownership of a potential
        hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved
        by our board of directors. delaware law also imposes some restrictions on
        mergers and other business combinations between us\\nand any holder of 15%
        or more for our outstanding common stock. although we believe these provisions
        provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential
        acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, these provisions apply\\neven
        if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay
        or prevent an acquisition of our company. \\nthe future issuance of additional
        shares of our common stock could cause dilution of ownership interests and

        interests of our current stockholders. we are authorized to issue 250\u00a0million

        voting common stock were issued and outstanding as of december\u00a031,\\n2013
        and 201.8\u00a0million were available for future issuance. the potential issuance
        of such additional shares of common stock, whether directly or pursuant to
        any conversion right of any convertible securities, may create downward pressure

        of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable
        for common stock for capital raising or other business purposes. future sales

        voting rights than holders of our common stock.  if persons engage in short
        sales of our\\ncommon stock, the price of our common stock may decline.  selling
        short is a technique used by a stockholder to take\\nadvantage of an anticipated
        decline in the price of a security. a significant number of short sales or
        a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can
        create downward pressure on the market price of a security. further\\nsales
        of common stock could cause even greater declines in the price of our common
        stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market, which
        could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our
        common stock.\\nholders of our securities could, therefore, experience a decline
        in the value of their investment as a result of short sales of our common
        stock.  we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable

        or \u201cthe company\u201d) provides mobile satellite services (\u201cmss\u201d)
        including voice and data\\ncommunications services globally via satellite.
        by providing wireless communications services in areas not served or underserved\\nby
        terrestrial wireless and wireline networks and in circumstances where terrestrial
        networks are not operational due to natural\\nor man-made disasters, we seek
        to meet our customers'' increasing desire for connectivity. we offer voice
        and data communication\\nservices over our network of in-orbit satellites
        and our active ground stations (or \u201cgateways\u201d), which we refer to\\ncollectively
        as the globalstar system.\\n\u00a0\u00a0\\nin 2006 we began a\\nprocess of
        designing, manufacturing and deploying a second-generation constellation of
        low earth orbit (\u201cleo\u201d) satellites\\nto replace our first-generation
        constellation. our second-generation satellites are designed to last twice
        as long in space, have\\n40% greater capacity and be built at a significantly
        lower cost compared to our first-generation satellites. this effort has culminated\\nin
        the successful launch of our second-generation satellites, with the fourth
        launch occurring on february 6, 2013. three prior\\nlaunches of second-generation
        satellites were successfully completed in october 2010, july 2011 and december
        2011.we have integrated\\nall of the new second-generation satellites with
        certain of our first-generation satellites to form our second-generation constellation.\\nthe
        restoration of our constellation\u2019s duplex capabilities was complete after
        the final satellite from our february 2013\\nlaunch was placed into service
        in august 2013. the restoration of duplex capabilities has resulted in a substantial
        increase in\\nservice levels, making our products and services more desirable
        to existing and potential customers. existing subscribers have\\nstarted to
        utilize our services more, measured by minutes of use on the globalstar system
        year over year, a trend that we expect\\nto continue. we are gaining new customers
        and winning back former customers, which continues to contribute to increases
        in duplex\\nrevenue. we offer a range of price-competitive products to the
        industrial, governmental and consumer markets. due to the unique\\ndesign
        of the globalstar system (and based on customer input), we believe that we
        offer the best voice quality among our peer group.\\n\u00a0\\nwe define a
        successful\\nlevel of service for our customers as measured by their ability
        to make uninterrupted calls of average duration for a system-wide\\naverage
        number of minutes per month. our goal is to provide service levels and call
        success rates equal to or better than our mss\\ncompetitors so our products
        and services are attractive to potential customers. we define voice quality
        as the ability to easily\\nhear, recognize and understand callers with imperceptible
        delay in the transmission. due to the unique design of the globalstar\\nsystem,
        by this measure our system outperforms geostationary (\u201cgeo\u201d) satellites
        used by some of our competitors. due\\nto the difference in signal travel
        distance, geo satellite signals must travel approximately 42,000 additional
        nautical miles,\\nwhich introduces considerable delay and signal degradation
        to geo calls. for our competitors using cross-linked satellite architectures,\\nwhich
        require multiple inter-satellite connections to complete a call, signal degradation
        and delay can result in compromised call\\nquality as compared to that experienced
        over the globalstar system.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n3\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nwe also
        compete aggressively\\non price. in 2004 we were the first mss company to
        offer bundled pricing plans that we adapted from the terrestrial wireless
        industry.\\nwe expect to continue to innovate and retain our position as the
        low cost, high quality leader in the mss industry.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\nour satellite

        31, 2012 to december 31, 2013.\\nbeginning in 2013, we initiated a process
        to deactivate certain suspended subscribers in our spot subscriber base. we
        deactivated\\napproximately 36,000 subscribers during the first quarter of
        2013. excluding these deactivated subscribers from our december 31,\\n2012
        subscriber count, total subscribers increased 11% from december 31, 2012 to
        december 31, 2013. we count \"subscribers\"\\nbased on the number of devices

        cases an attractive\\nalternative to mobile satellite communications services
        in environments where multiple users will access the service within a defined\\ngeographic
        area and cellular or ground phone service is not available. our fixed units
        also may be mounted on vehicles, barges\\nand construction equipment and benefit
        from the ability to have higher gain antennas. our fixed voice and data service
        plans are\\nsimilar to our mobile voice and data plans and offer similar flexibility.
        in addition to offering monthly service plans, our fixed\\nphones can be configured

        world-wide allocation of radio frequency spectrum through the international
        radio frequency tables administered by the international\\ntelecommunications
        union (\u201citu\u201d). we believe access to this global spectrum enables
        us to design satellites, networks\\nand terrestrial infrastructure enhancements
        more cost effectively because the products and services can be deployed and
        sold worldwide.\\nin addition, this broad spectrum assignment enhances our

        two blocks of non-contiguous radio frequencies in the 1.6/2.4 ghz band commonly
        referred\\nto as the big leo spectrum band. specifically, the fcc has authorized
        us to operate between 1610-1618.725 mhz for \u201cuplink\u201d\\ncommunications
        from mobile earth terminals to our satellites and between 2483.5-2500 mhz
        for \u201cdownlink\u201d communications\\nfrom our satellites to our mobile
        earth terminals. the fcc has also authorized us to operate our four domestic

        and registered\\nour second-generation satellites in france. in october 2010,
        the french ministry for the economy, industry and employment authorized\\nglobalstar
        europe sarl, now globalstar europe sas (\u201cglobalstar europe\u201d), our
        wholly owned subsidiary, to operate our\\nsecond-generation satellites.\u00a0
        in november 2010, arcep, the french independent administrative authority of
        post and electronic\\ncommunications regulations, granted a license to globalstar
        europe to provide mobile satellite service. in august 2011, the french\\nministry
        in charge of space operations issued us final authorization and has undertaken
        the registration of our second-generation\\nsatellites with the united nations
        as provided under the convention on registration of objects launched into
        outer space. in accordance\\nwith this authorization to operate the second-generation
        satellites, in early 2014, we completed the enhancements to the existing\\ngateway
        operations in aussaguel, france to include satellite operations and control
        functions. we now have redundant satellite\\noperation control facilities
        in milpitas, california and aussaguel, france.\\n\u00a0\\nthe french national\\nfrequencies
        agency (\u201canfr\u201d) is representing us before the itu for purposes of
        receiving assignments of orbital positions\\nand conducting international
        coordination efforts to address any interference concerns. anfr submitted
        the technical papers to\\nthe itu on our behalf in july 2009. as with the
        first-generation constellation, the itu will require us to coordinate our
        spectrum\\nassignments with other companies that use any portion of our spectrum
        bands. we cannot predict how long the coordination process\\nwill take; however,
        we are able to use the frequencies during the coordination process in accordance
        with our national licenses.\\n\u00a0\\nin addition to having\\ncompleted the
        french licensing and registration of our second-generation satellites, in
        march 2011 we obtained all authorizations\\nnecessary from the fcc to operate
        our domestic gateways with our second-generation satellites.\\n\u00a0\\nour
        former non-geostationary\\nsatellite orbit (\u201cngso\u201d) satellite constellation
        license issued by the fcc was valid until april 2013. we have filed\\nan application
        to modify and extend this license. under the fcc\u2019s rules, we may continue
        to operate our constellation pending\\nthe fcc\u2019s approval of our application.
        this license application applies only to our continued use of our first-generation\\nsatellites.\\n\u00a0\\npotential
        terrestrial\\nuse of globalstar spectrum\\n\u00a0\\nin february 2003,\\nthe
        fcc adopted rules that permit satellite service providers such as globalstar
        to establish terrestrial networks utilizing the\\nancillary terrestrial component
        (\u201catc\u201d) of their licensed spectrum.\u00a0 atc authorization enables
        the integration\\nof a satellite-based service with terrestrial wireless services,
        resulting in a hybrid mobile satellite services/atc network designed\\nto
        provide advanced services and broad coverage throughout the united states.
        an atc deployment could extend our services to urban\\nareas and inside buildings
        where satellite services are currently not available, as well as to rural
        and remote areas that lack\\nterrestrial wireless services.\\n\u00a0\\nin
        order to establish\\nan atc network, a satellite service provider must first
        meet certain specified requirements commonly known as the \u201cgating\\ncriteria.\u201d\u00a0currently,
        these criteria would require us to provide continuous coverage over the united
        states and have\\nan in-orbit spare satellite. additionally, atc services
        must be complementary or ancillary to mobile satellite services in an \"integrated\\nservice
        offering,\" which can be achieved by using \"dual-mode\" devices capable of
        transmitting and receiving mobile\\nsatellite and atc signals, or providing
        \u201cother evidence\u201d that the satellite service provider meets the requirement.\\nfurther,
        user subscriptions that include atc services must also include mobile satellite
        services. because of these requirements,\\nthe number of potential early stage
        competitors in providing atc services is limited, as only mobile satellite
        services operators\\nwho offer commercial satellite services can provide atc
        services.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n8\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nin january 2006, the\\nfcc
        granted our application to add an atc service to our existing mobile satellite
        services. in april 2008, the fcc issued a decision\\nextending our atc authorization
        from 11mhz to a total of 19.275 mhz of our spectrum. outside the united states,
        other countries\\nare considering implementing regulations to facilitate atc
        services. we expect to pursue atc and/or terrestrial licenses in jurisdictions\\nsuch
        as canada and the european community as market conditions dictate.\\n\u00a0\\nin
        july 2010, the\\nfcc instituted a rulemaking proceeding and notice of inquiry
        to consider whether certain gating criteria should be revised or eliminated\\nso
        as to permit satellite operators to exercise greater flexibility in utilizing
        atc. interested parties, including globalstar,\\nfiled comments in these proceedings
        in september 2010.\u00a0in these proceedings, we have proposed the elimination
        of, or substantial\\nmodifications to, the existing gating criteria.\\n\u00a0\\non
        november 13, 2012,\\nwe filed a petition for rulemaking with the fcc, requesting
        the substantial revision and/or elimination of the gating criteria\\nfor atc
        services as well as regulatory flexibility to offer terrestrial wireless services,
        including mobile broadband services,\\nover 19.275 mhz of our licensed big
        leo spectrum allocation. in our petition, we proposed a \u201cnear-term\u201d
        plan for terrestrial\\nrelief in the 11.5 mhz of our \u201cdownlink\u201d
        spectrum at 2483.5-2495 mhz to offer innovative services such as a proposed\\nterrestrial
        low power service (\u201ctlps\u201d). under this proposal, we would utilize
        both our exclusively licensed 11.5 mhz\\nof mss spectrum at 2483.5 to 2495
        mhz, as well as the contiguous 10.5 mhz of unlicensed industrial, scientific
        and medical (\u201cism\u201d)\\nspectrum located at 2473 to 2483.5 mhz to
        provide a carrier-grade fourth non overlapping 22 mhz channel under the ieee
        802.11 standard\\nwhere most wifi use currently exists. significantly, we
        proposed to use the 10.5 mhz of unlicensed ism spectrum on a non-exclusive\\nbasis
        with no special protections against interference from adjacent bands.\\n\u00a0\\nadditionally,
        in our\\npetition for rulemaking, we have also proposed a \u201clong-term\u201d
        plan to obtain authority over our exclusively licensed\\nspectrum at 1610-1617.775
        mhz in order to provide additional mobile broadband services based on the
        long term evolution (\u201clte\u201d)\\nstandard.\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0on november\\n1,
        2013, the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (\u201cnprm\u201d) commencing
        a formal proceeding to permit us to deploy\\na terrestrial broadband network
        over 22 mhz of spectrum in the 2.4 ghz band. the proposed rules essentially
        eliminate the former\\ngating criteria and would allow us to provide low power
        terrestrial broadband services over our licensed 11.5 mhz s-band spectrum\\nat
        2483.5 \u2013 2495 mhz, as well as the non-exclusive use of the adjacent 10.5
        mhz unlicensed spectrum at 2473 \u2013 2483.5\\nmhz.\\n\u00a0\\nduring 2014,
        we will\\nactively participate in this formal rulemaking proceeding, as well
        as actively prosecute our petition for rulemaking regarding\\nour long-term
        plan.\\n\u00a0\\nnational regulation of service\\nproviders\\n\u00a0\\nin
        order to operate\\ngateways, applicable laws and regulations require the igos
        and our affiliates in each country to obtain a license or licenses from\\nthat
        country''s telecommunications regulatory authority. in addition, the gateway
        operator must enter into appropriate interconnection\\nand financial settlement
        agreements with local and interexchange telecommunications providers. all
        24 active gateways, which we\\nand the igos operate, are licensed.\\n\u00a0\\nour
        subscriber equipment\\ngenerally must be type certified in countries in which
        it is sold or leased. the manufacturers of the equipment and our affiliates\\nor
        igos are jointly responsible for securing type certification. we have received
        type certification in multiple countries for\\neach of our products.\\n\u00a0\\nsatellites\\n\u00a0\\nbeginning
        in the late\\n1990\u2019s, we launched our first-generation satellite constellation.
        in 2007 we launched spare first-generation satellites to\\nprovide support
        for our duplex, simplex and spot services.\\n\u00a0\\nwe launched second-generation\\nsatellites
        in four batches during the period october 2010 through february 2013. as of
        august 2013, we had placed into service\\nall of these second-generation satellites.
        we designed our second-generation satellites to support our current lineup
        of duplex,\\nspot, and simplex products and services, and these satellites
        are backwards compatible with our first-generation ground network\\nand satellites,
        as well as forward compatible with our second-generation ground network.\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\u00a0we
        designed\\nthe second-generation satellites to have a 15-year life from the
        date the satellites are first positioned into their operational\\norbits,
        twice the useful life of the first-generation satellites.\u00a0this longer
        life is achieved by increasing the solar array\\nand battery capacity, using
        a larger fuel tank, more redundancy for key satellite equipment, and improved
        radiation specifications\\nand additional lot level testing for all susceptible
        electronic components, in order to account for the accumulated dosage of radiation\\nencountered
        during a 15-year mission at the operational altitude of the satellites.\u00a0the
        second-generation satellites use passive\\ns-band antennas on the body of
        the spacecraft providing additional shielding for the active amplifiers which
        are located inside\\nthe spacecraft, unlike the first-generation amplifiers
        that were located on the outside as part of the active antenna array.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n9\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\neach
        satellite has\\na high degree of on-board subsystem redundancy, an on-board
        fault detection system and isolation and recovery for safe and quick\\nrisk
        mitigation. our ability to reconfigure the orbital location of each satellite
        provides us with operating flexibility and continuity\\nof service. the design
        of our space segment and primary and secondary ground control system facilitates
        the real-time intervention\\nand management of the satellite constellation
        and service upgrades via hardware and software enhancements.\\n\u00a0\\ntoday
        we have adequate\\nsatellites to provide duplex, spot and simplex services.\\n\u00a0\\nground
        network\\n\u00a0\\nour satellites communicate\\nwith a network of 24 active
        gateways, each of which serves an area of approximately 700,000 to 1,000,000
        square miles.\u00a0the\\ndesign of our orbital planes ensures that generally
        at least one satellite is visible from any point on the earth''s surface between\\n70\u00b0
        north latitude and 70\u00b0 south latitude. a gateway must be within line-of-sight
        of a satellite and the satellite must\\nbe within line-of-sight of the subscriber
        to provide services. we have positioned our gateways to cover most of the
        world''s land\\nand population. we own 12 of these gateways and the rest are
        owned by igos. in addition, we have spare parts in storage, including\\nantennas
        and gateway electronic equipment, including two un-deployed stored gateways.\\n\u00a0\\neach
        of our gateways\\nhas multiple antennas that communicate with our satellites
        and pass calls seamlessly between antenna beams and satellites as the\\nsatellites
        traverse the gateways, thereby reflecting the signals from our users'' terminals
        to our gateways. once a satellite acquires\\na signal from an end-user, the
        globalstar system authenticates the user and establishes the voice or data
        channel to complete the\\ncall to the public switched telephone network, to
        a cellular or another wireless network or to the internet (for a data call
        including\\nsimplex).\\n\u00a0\\nwe believe that our\\nterrestrial gateways
        provide a number of advantages over the in-orbit switching used by our main
        competitor, including better call\\nquality, reduced call latency and convenient
        regionalized local phone numbers for inbound and outbound calling. we also
        believe\\nthat our network''s design, which relies on terrestrial gateways
        rather than in-orbit switching, enables faster and more cost-effective\\nsystem
        maintenance and upgrades because the system''s software and much of its hardware
        is based on the ground. our multiple gateways\\nallow us to reconfigure our
        system quickly to extend another gateway''s coverage to make up some or all
        of the coverage of a disabled\\ngateway or to handle increased call capacity
        resulting from surges in demand.\\n\u00a0\\nour network uses qualcomm''s\\npatented
        cdma technology to permit diversity combining of the strongest available signals.
        patented receivers in our handsets track\\nthe pilot channel or signaling
        channel as well as three additional communications channels simultaneously.
        compared to other satellite\\nand network architectures, we offer superior
        call clarity with virtually no discernible delay. our system architecture
        provides\\nfull frequency re-use. this maximizes diversity (which maximizes
        quality) and capacity as we can reuse the assigned spectrum in\\nevery satellite
        beam in every satellite. our network also works with internet protocol (\u201cip\u201d)
        data for reliable transmission\\nof ip messages.\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0we designed\\nour
        second-generation satellites to support our current lineup of duplex, spot,
        and simplex products and services, and to be backwards\\ncompatible with our
        first-generation ground network and satellites, as well as forward compatible
        with our second-generation ground\\nnetwork.\\n\u00a0\\nalthough our network\\nis
        currently cdma-based, it is configured so that it can also support one or
        more other air interfaces that we may select in the\\nfuture. for example,
        we have developed a non-qualcomm proprietary cdma technology for our spot
        and simplex services. because our\\nsatellites are essentially \"mirrors in
        the sky,\" and all of our network''s switches and hardware are located on
        the ground,\\nwe can easily and relatively inexpensively modify our ground
        hardware and software to use other wave forms to meet customer demands\\nfor
        new and innovative services and products.\\n\u00a0\\nwe own and operate\\ngateways
        in the united states, canada, venezuela, puerto rico, france, brazil and\u00a0singapore.\\n\u00a0\\nindustry\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        compete in the\\nmobile satellite services sector of the global communications
        industry. mobile satellite service operators provide voice and data\\nservices
        using a network of one or more satellites and associated ground facilities.
        mobile satellite services are usually complementary\\nto, and interconnected
        with, other forms of terrestrial communications services and infrastructure
        and are intended to respond\\nto users'' desires for connectivity at all times
        and locations. customers typically use satellite voice and data communications\\nin
        situations where existing terrestrial wireline and wireless communications
        networks are impaired or do not exist.\\n\u00a0\\nworldwide, government\\norganizations,
        military, natural disaster aid associations, event-driven response agencies
        and corporate security teams depend\\non mobile and fixed voice and data communications
        services on a regular basis. businesses with global operating scope require
        communications\\nservices when operating in remote locations around the world.
        mobile satellite services users span the forestry, maritime, government,\\noil
        and gas, mining, leisure, emergency services, construction and transportation
        sectors, among others. we believe many such customers\\nincreasingly view
        satellite communications services as critical to their daily operations.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n10\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nover
        the past two\\ndecades, the global mobile satellite services market has experienced
        significant growth. increasingly, better-tailored, improved-technology\\nproducts
        and services are creating new channels of demand for mobile satellite services.
        growth in demand for mobile satellite\\nvoice services is driven by the declining
        cost of these services, the diminishing size and lower costs of the handsets,
        as well\\nas, heightened demand by governments, businesses and individuals
        for ubiquitous global voice coverage. growth in mobile satellite\\ndata services
        is driven by the rollout of new applications requiring higher bandwidth, as
        well as low cost data collection and\\nasset tracking devices and technological
        improvements permitting integration of mobile satellite services over smartphones
        and\\nother wi-fi enabled devices.\\n\u00a0\\ncommunications industry\\nsectors
        that are relevant to our business include:\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u2022mobile satellite
        services, which provide customers with connectivity to mobile and fixed devices
        using a network of satellites\\nand ground facilities;\\n\\n\u2022fixed satellite
        services, which use geostationary satellites to provide customers with voice
        and broadband communications links\\nbetween fixed points on the earth''s
        surface; and\\n\\n\u2022terrestrial services, which use a terrestrial network
        to provide wireless or wireline connectivity and are complementary to\\nsatellite
        services.\\n\u00a0\\nwithin the major satellite\\nsectors, fixed satellite
        services and mobile satellite services operators differ significantly from
        each other. fixed satellite\\nservices providers, such as intelsat ltd., eutelsat
        communications and ses s.a., and aperture terminal companies, such as hughes\\nand
        gilat satellite networks, are characterized by large, often stationary or
        \"fixed,\" ground terminals that send and\\nreceive high-bandwidth signals
        to and from the satellite network for video and high speed data customers
        and international telephone\\nmarkets. on the other hand, mobile satellite
        services providers, such as globalstar, inmarsat p.l.c. (\u201cinmarsat\u201d)
        and\\niridium communications, inc. (\u201ciridium\u201d), focus more on voice
        and data services (including data services which track\\nthe location of remote
        assets such as shipping containers), where mobility or small sized terminals
        are essential. as mobile satellite\\nterminals begin to offer higher bandwidth
        to support a wider range of applications, we expect mobile satellite services
        operators\\nwill increasingly compete with fixed satellite services operators.\\n\u00a0\\nleo
        systems reduce\\ntransmission delay compared to a geosynchronous system due
        to the shorter distance signals have to travel. in addition, leo systems\\nare
        less prone to signal blockage and, consequently, we believe provide a better
        overall quality of service.\\n\u00a0\\ncompetition\\n\u00a0\\nthe global communications\\nindustry
        is highly competitive. we currently face substantial competition from other
        service providers that offer a range of mobile\\nand fixed communications
        options. our most direct competition comes from other global mobile satellite
        services providers. our\\ntwo largest global competitors are inmarsat and

        a fleet of geostationary satellites. due to its multiple-satellite geostationary
        system, inmarsat''s coverage area extends\\nto and covers most bodies of water
        more completely than we do. accordingly, inmarsat is the leading provider
        of satellite communications\\nservices to the maritime sector. inmarsat also
        offers global land-based and aeronautical communications services. inmarsat
        generally\\ndoes not sell directly to customers. rather, it markets its products
        and services principally through a variety of distributors,\\nwho, in most
        cases, sell to additional downstream entities who sell to the ultimate customer.
        we compete with inmarsat in several\\nkey areas, particularly in our maritime
        markets.\u00a0during 2011, inmarsat launched a mobile handset designed to
        compete with\\nboth iridium\u2019s mobile handset service and our gsp-1700

        non-governmental organizations and consumers. iridium sells its products\\nand
        services to commercial end users through a wholesale distribution network.
        we have faced increased competition from iridium\\nin some of our target markets.
        during 2011, iridium introduced a product that delivers remote communication
        features including\\nsend and receive text messaging, interactive sos, and
        message delivery information.\\n\u00a0\\nwe compete with regional\\nmobile

        labor costs and interest on outstanding debt, which we expect will be\\nreflected
        in capital expenditures primarily through 2015. the nature of these purchases
        requires us to enter into long-term fixed\\nprice contracts. we cannot be
        assured that operating cash flows and other previously committed funding will

        which are contingent on a number of factors.\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0in prior periods\\nour
        ability to generate revenue and cash flow was impacted adversely by our inability
        to offer commercially acceptable levels of\\nduplex service due to the degradation
        of our first-generation constellation. as a result, we improved the design
        of our second-generation\\nconstellation to last twice as long in space, have
        40% greater capacity and be built at a significantly lower cost as compared\\nto
        our first-generation constellation. the health of our constellation depends
        on the maintenance of these satellites, which are\\ntechnically complex. anomalies
        with our satellites may develop, and we cannot guarantee that we could successfully
        develop and\\nimplement a solution to them.\\n\u00a0\\nour ground stations\\nwere
        initially designed to operate with our first-generation satellites. certain
        of these ground stations will require upgrades\\nto enable us to integrate
        the technology and service offerings with our second-generation satellites.
        we have entered into various\\ncontracts to upgrade our ground network but
        the completion of these upgrades may not be successful.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n14\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\nour
        ability to generate\\nrevenue and positive cash flow will depend upon our

        and maintain our ground stations, maintain a sufficient number of subscribers,
        introduce new product and service offerings\\nsuccessfully, and compete successfully
        against other mobile satellite service providers to gain new subscribers.\\n\u00a0\\nour
        satellites have a limited life and\\nwill degrade over time, which may cause
        our network to be compromised and which may materially and adversely affect
        our business,\\nprospects and profitability. we may not be able to procure
        additional second-generation satellites on reasonable terms.\\n\u00a0\\nsince
        our first satellites\\nwere launched in the 1990\u2019s, some first-generation
        satellites have failed in orbit and have been retired, and we expect others\\nto
        fail in the future. we consider a satellite \"failed\" only when it can no
        longer provide any communications service,\\nand we do not intend to undertake
        any further efforts to return it to service or when the other satellite subsystems
        can no longer\\nsupport operations. in-orbit failure may result from various
        causes, including component failure, loss of power or fuel, inability\\nto
        control positioning of the satellite, solar or other astronomical events,
        including solar radiation and flares, the quality\\nof construction, gradual
        degradation of solar panels, the durability of components, and collision with
        other satellites or space\\ndebris. any of these causes, including radiation
        induced failure of satellite components, may result in damage to or loss of
        a\\nsatellite before the end of its currently expected life.\\n\u00a0\\nas
        a result of the\\nissues described above, some of our in-orbit satellites
        may experience temporary outages or may not otherwise be fully functioning\\nat
        any given time. there are some remote tools we use to remedy certain types
        of problems affecting the performance of our satellites,\\nbut the physical
        repair of satellites in space is not feasible. as it is not economically feasible,
        we do not insure our satellites\\nagainst in-orbit failures after an initial
        period of six months, whether the failures are caused by internal or external
        factors.\\nalthough our second-generation satellites were designed to provide
        commercial service over a 15-year life, we can provide no assurance\\nas to
        whether any or all of them will continue in operation for their full 15-year
        design life.\\n\u00a0\u00a0\\nall satellites have\\na limited life and degrade
        over time. in order to maintain commercially acceptable service coverage long-term,
        we must obtain and\\nlaunch additional satellites. as discussed in note 8
        to our consolidated financial statements, we and thales may negotiate the\\nterms
        of a follow-on contract for additional satellites, but we can provide no assurance
        as to whether we will ultimately agree\\non commercial terms for such a purchase.
        if we are unable to agree with thales on commercial terms for the purchase
        of additional\\nsatellites, we may enter into negotiations with one or more
        other satellite manufacturers, but we cannot provide any assurance\\nthat
        these negotiations will be successful either.\\n\u00a0\\nrapid and significant
        technological\\nchanges in the satellite communications industry may impair
        our competitive position and require us to make significant additional\\ncapital
        expenditures.\\n\u00a0\\nthe hardware and software\\nwe currently utilize
        in operating our gateways were designed and manufactured over 15 years ago
        and portions have deteriorated.\\nwe have contracted to replace the digital
        hardware and software in the future; however the original equipment may become
        less reliable\\nas it ages and will be more difficult and expensive to service.
        it may be difficult or impossible to obtain all necessary replacement\\nparts
        for the hardware before the new equipment and software is fully deployed.
        we expect to face competition in the future from\\ncompanies using new technologies
        and new satellite systems. the space and communications industries are subject
        to rapid advances\\nand innovations in technology. new technology could render
        our system obsolete or less competitive by satisfying consumer demand\\nin
        more attractive ways or through the introduction of incompatible standards.
        particular technological developments that could\\nadversely affect us include
        the deployment by our competitors of new satellites with greater power, greater
        flexibility, greater\\nefficiency or greater capabilities, as well as continuing
        improvements in terrestrial wireless technologies. we have had to commit,\\nand
        must continue to commit, to make significant capital expenditures to keep
        up with technological changes and remain competitive.\\ncustomer acceptance
        of the services and products that we offer will continually be affected by
        technology-based differences in\\nour product and service offerings. new technologies
        may be protected by patents and therefore may not be available to us.\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        may be unable to establish a worldwide\\nservice network due to the absence
        of gateways in certain important regions of the world, which may limit our
        growth and our ability\\nto compete.\\n\u00a0\\nour objective is to\\nestablish
        a worldwide service network, either directly or through igos, but to date
        we have been unable to do so in certain areas\\nof the world and we may not
        succeed in doing so in the future. we have been unable to finance our own
        gateways or to find capable\\nigos for several important regions and countries,
        including eastern and southern africa, india, china, and certain parts of
        southeast\\nasia. in addition to the lack of global service availability,
        cost-effective roaming is not yet available in certain countries\\nbecause
        the igos have been unable to reach business arrangements with one another.
        this could reduce overall demand for our products\\nand services and undermine
        our value for potential users who require service in these areas.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\\n15\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nrestrictive

        mss spectrum to provide terrestrial wireless services depends upon action
        by the fcc, which we cannot control.\\n\u00a0\\nour business plan\\nincludes
        utilizing approximately 20 mhz of our licensed mss spectrum to provide terrestrial
        wireless services, including mobile\\nbroadband applications, within the united
        states. in pursuit of these plans, the fcc has released an nprm to substantially
        eliminate\\nthe gating criteria under the existing atc regime and permit us
        to offer low power terrestrial mobile broadband services over a\\nportion
        of our licensed mss spectrum. as part of this formal proceeding, if the fcc
        does not ultimately adopt satisfactory rules,\\nour anticipated future revenues
        and profitability could be reduced. we can provide no assurance that the fcc
        will finalize satisfactorily\\nthis nrpm or how long the regulatory process
        to obtain this relief will take. if we are unable to achieve the rule changes
        in the\\nnprm, then our only ability to utilize our mss spectrum for terrestrial
        applications will be pursuant to the existing atc regulatory\\nregime that
        requires many restrictive conditions called gating criteria.\\n\u00a0\\nfuture
        regulatory decisions could reduce\\nour existing spectrum allocation or impose
        additional spectrum sharing agreements on us, which could adversely affect
        our services\\nand operations.\\n\u00a0\\nunder the fcc''s plan\\nfor mobile
        satellite services in our frequency bands, we must share frequencies in the
        united states with other licensed mobile\\nsatellite services operators. to
        date, there are no other authorized cdma-based mobile satellite services operators
        and no pending\\napplications for authorization. however the fcc or other
        regulatory authorities may require us to share spectrum with other systems\\nthat
        are not currently licensed by the united states or any other jurisdiction.
        on february 11, 2013, iridium filed its own petition\\nfor rulemaking seeking
        to have the fcc reallocate 2.725 mhz of big leo spectrum from 1616-1618.725
        mhz to iridium\u2019s exclusive\\nuse. iridium also filed a motion to consolidate
        its petition with our petition for rulemaking. although the fcc has received
        comments\\non iridium\u2019s petition, it has not taken any substantive action
        with respect to it. an adverse result in this proceeding could\\nmaterially
        affect our ability to provide both duplex and simplex mobile satellite services.\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        registered our\\nsecond-generation constellation with the itu through france
        rather than the united states. the french radiofrequency spectrum regulatory\\nagency,
        anfr, submitted the technical papers filing to the itu on our behalf in july
        2009. as with the first-generation constellation,\\nthe itu requires us to
        coordinate our spectrum assignments with other administrators and operators
        that use any portion of our\\nspectrum frequency bands. we are actively engaged
        in but cannot predict how long the coordination process will take; however,
        we\\nare able to use the frequencies during the coordination process in accordance
        with our national licenses.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n16\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nin 2013,
        the fcc issued\\na notice of proposed rulemaking and commenced a proceeding
        to consider, among other things, expanding the use of terrestrial mobile\\nbroadband
        devices within the 5 ghz band.\u00a0our c-band forward link (earth station
        to satellite) operates within the 5 ghz band\\nat 5091-5250 mhz.\u00a0as part
        of this proceeding, the fcc has requested comments regarding increasing power
        limits and eliminating\\nthe restriction against outdoor uses of u-nii-1 devices,
        essentially outdoor wifi access points, operating within the same frequencies\\nas
        our c-band forward link.\u00a0we filed comments in opposition to these changes
        to the technical rules due to the substantial\\nrisk of harmful interference
        that these deployments could have on our system.\u00a0if the fcc permits unlimited
        outdoor deployment\\nof u-nii-1 devices, our ability to provide mobile satellite
        services could be negatively affected. we can provide no assurance\\nas to
        the outcome of this proceeding or any other fcc action.\\n\u00a0\\nspectrum
        values historically have been\\nvolatile, which could cause the value of our
        business to fluctuate.\\n\u00a0\\nour business plan\\nincludes forming strategic
        partnerships to maximize the use and value of our spectrum, network assets
        and combined service offerings\\nin the united states and internationally.
        value that we may be able to realize from such partnerships will depend in
        part on the\\nvalue ascribed to our spectrum. historically, valuations of
        spectrum in other frequency bands have been volatile, and we cannot\\npredict
        the future value that we may be able to realize for our spectrum and other
        assets. in addition, to the extent that the\\nfcc takes action that makes
        additional spectrum available or promotes the more flexible use or greater
        availability (e.g., via\\nspectrum leasing or new spectrum sales) of existing
        satellite or terrestrial spectrum allocations, the availability of such additional\\nspectrum
        could reduce the value that we may be able to realize for our spectrum.\\n\u00a0\\nour
        business is subject to extensive\\ngovernment regulation, which mandates how
        we may operate our business and may increase our cost of providing services,
        slow our\\nexpansion into new markets and subject our services to additional
        competitive pressures.\\n\u00a0\\nour ownership and\\noperation of an mss
        system is subject to significant regulation in the united states by the fcc
        and in foreign jurisdictions by\\nsimilar authorities.\u00a0additionally,
        our use of our licensed spectrum globally is subject to coordination by the
        itu.\u00a0our\\nsecond-generation constellation has been licensed and registered
        in france.\u00a0the rules and regulations of the fcc or these\\nforeign authorities
        may change and may not continue to permit our operations as presently conducted
        or as we plan to conduct them.\\n\u00a0\\nfailure to provide\\nservices in
        accordance with the terms of our licenses or failure to operate our satellites,
        ground stations, or other terrestrial\\nfacilities (including those necessary
        to provide atc services) as required by our licenses and applicable government
        regulations\\ncould result in the imposition of government sanctions against
        us, up to and including cancellation of our licenses.\\n\u00a0\\nour system
        requires\\nregulatory authorization in each of the markets in which we or
        the igos provide service. we and the igos may not be able to obtain\\nor retain
        all regulatory approvals needed for operations. for example, the company with
        which the original owners of our first-generation\\nnetwork contracted to
        establish an independent gateway operation in south africa was unable to obtain
        an operating license from\\nthe republic of south africa and abandoned the
        business in 2001. regulatory changes, such as those resulting from judicial
        decisions\\nor adoption of treaties, legislation or regulation in countries
        where we operate or intend to operate, may also significantly affect\\nour
        business. because regulations in each country are different, we may not be
        aware if some of the igos and/or persons with which\\nwe or they do business
        do not hold the requisite licenses and approvals.\\n\u00a0\\nour current regulatory\\napprovals
        could now be, or could become, insufficient in the view of foreign regulatory
        authorities. furthermore, any additional\\nnecessary approvals may not be
        granted on a timely basis, or at all, in all jurisdictions in which we wish
        to offer services, and\\napplicable restrictions in those jurisdictions could
        become unduly burdensome.\\n\u00a0\\nour operations are\\nsubject to certain
        regulations of the united states state department''s directorate of defense
        trade controls (i.e., the export\\nof satellites and related technical data),
        united states treasury department''s office of foreign assets control (i.e.,
        financial\\ntransactions) and the united states commerce department''s bureau
        of industry and security (i.e., our gateways and phones). these\\nregulations
        may limit or delay our ability to operate in a particular country. as new
        laws and regulations are issued, we may be\\nrequired to modify our business
        plans or operations. if we fail to comply with these regulations in any country,
        we could be subject\\nto sanctions that could affect, materially and adversely,
        our ability to operate in that country. failure to obtain the authorizations\\nnecessary
        to use our assigned radio frequency spectrum and to distribute our products
        in certain countries could have a material\\nadverse effect on our ability
        to generate revenue and on our overall competitive position.\\n\u00a0\\nthe
        implementation of our business plan\\ndepends on increased demand for wireless
        communications services via satellite, both for our existing services and
        products and\\nfor new services and products. if this increased demand does
        not occur, our revenues and profitability may not increase as we expect.\\n\u00a0\\ndemand
        for wireless\\ncommunication services via satellite may not grow, or may even
        shrink, either generally or in particular geographic markets, for\\nparticular
        types of services or during particular time periods. a lack of demand could
        impair our ability to sell our services\\nand develop and successfully market
        new services, or could exert downward pressure on prices, or both. this, in
        turn, could decrease\\nour revenues and profitability and adversely affect
        our ability to increase our revenues and profitability over time.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n17\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        plan to introduce\\nadditional duplex, spot, and simplex products and services.
        however, we cannot predict with certainty the potential longer term\\ndemand
        for these products and services or the extent to which we will be able to
        meet demand. our business plan assumes growing\\nour duplex subscriber base
        beyond levels achieved in the past, rapidly growing our spot and simplex subscriber
        base and returning\\nthe business to profitability.\\n\u00a0\\nthe success
        of our\\nbusiness plan will depend on a number of factors, including:\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u2022\\nour
        ability to maintain the health, capacity and control of our satellites;\\n\\n\u2022\\nour
        ability to maintain the health of our ground network;\\n\\n\u2022\\nour ability
        to influence the level of market acceptance and demand for all of our services;\\n\\n\u2022\\nour

        ability to retain current customers and obtain new customers;\\n\\n\u2022\\nour
        ability to obtain additional business using our existing spectrum resources
        both in the united states and internationally;\\n\\n\u2022\\nour ability to

        ability to provide attractive service offerings at competitive prices to our
        target markets.\\n\\n\u00a0\\nwe depend on igos to market our services\\nin
        important regions around the world. if the igos are unable to do this successfully,
        we will not be able to grow our business\\nin those areas as rapidly as we
        expect.\\n\u00a0\\nalthough we derive\\nmost of our revenue from retail sales
        to end users in the united states, canada, a portion of western europe, central
        america and\\nportions of south america, either directly or through agents,
        dealers and resellers, we depend on igos to purchase, install, operate\\nand
        maintain gateway equipment, to sell phones and data user terminals, and to
        market our services in other regions where these\\nigos hold exclusive or
        non-exclusive rights. not all of the igos have been successful and, in some
        regions, they have not initiated\\nservice or sold as much usage as originally
        anticipated. some of the igos are not earning revenues sufficient to fund
        their operating\\ncosts due to the operational issues we experienced with
        our first-generation satellites. although we expect these igos to return\\nto
        profitability with the return of duplex service, if they are unable to continue
        in business, we will lose the revenue we receive\\nfor selling equipment to
        them and providing services to their customers. although we have implemented
        a strategy for the acquisition\\nof certain igos when circumstances permit,
        we may not be able to continue to implement this strategy on favorable terms
        and may\\nnot be able to realize the additional efficiencies that we anticipate
        from this strategy. in some regions it is impracticable to\\nacquire the igos
        either because local regulatory requirements or business or cultural norms
        do not permit an acquisition, because\\nthe expected revenue increase from
        an acquisition would be insufficient to justify the transaction, or because
        the igo will not\\nsell at a price acceptable to us. in those regions, our
        revenue and profits may be adversely affected if those igos do not fulfill\\ntheir
        own business plans to increase substantially their sales of services and products.\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        rely on a limited number of key vendors\\nfor timely supply of equipment and
        services. if our key vendors fail to provide equipment and services to us,
        we may face difficulties\\nin finding alternative sources and may not be able
        to operate our business successfully.\\n\u00a0\\nwe also have a limited\\nquantity
        of our duplex handsets remaining in inventory and have not contracted with
        a manufacturer to produce additional inventory.\\nwe have depended on qualcomm
        as the exclusive manufacturer of phones using the is 41 cdma north american
        standard, which incorporates\\nqualcomm proprietary technology. this contract
        was cancelled in march 2013 and we are working with qualcomm to resolve issues
        related\\nto the termination. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements
        for further discussion. although we have contracted with\\nhughes and ericsson
        to provide new hardware and software for our ground component, there could
        be a substantial period of time\\nin which their products or services are
        not available and qualcomm no longer supports our products and services.\\n\u00a0\\nadditionally,
        we depend\\non our product manufacturers to provide us with our inventory.
        if these manufacturers do not take on future orders or fail to perform\\nunder
        our current contracts, we may be unable to continue to produce and sell our
        inventory to customers at a reasonable cost to\\nus or there may be delays
        in production and sales.\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\n18\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nwe depend
        in large part on the efforts\\nof third parties for the retail sale of our
        services and products. the inability of these third parties to sell our services
        and\\nproducts successfully may decrease our future revenue and profitability.\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        derive a large\\nportion of our revenue from products and services sold through
        independent agents, dealers and resellers, including, outside the\\nunited
        states, igos. if these third parties are unable to market our products and
        services successfully, our future revenue and\\nprofitability may decrease.\\n\u00a0\\nlack
        of availability of electronic components\\nfrom the electronics industry,
        as needed in our retail products, our gateways, and our satellites, could
        delay or adversely impact\\nour operations.\\n\u00a0\\nwe rely upon the availability\\nof
        components, materials and component parts from the electronics industry. the
        electronics industry is subject to occasional shortages\\nin parts availability
        depending on fluctuations in supply and demand. industry shortages may result
        in delayed shipments of materials,\\nor increased prices, or both. as a consequence,
        elements of our operation which use electronic parts, such as our retail products,\\nour
        gateways and our satellites, could be subject to delays or cost increases,
        or both.\\n\u00a0\\nproduct liability, product replacement,\\nor recall costs
        could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        are subject to\\nproduct liability and product recall claims if any of our
        products and services are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons\\nor
        damage to property. if any of our products proves to be defective, we may
        need to recall and/or redesign them. in addition,\\nany claim or product recall
        that results in significant adverse publicity may negatively affect our business,
        financial condition,\\nor results of operations. we maintain product liability
        insurance, but this insurance may not adequately cover losses related to\\nproduct
        liability claims brought against us. we may also be a defendant in class action
        litigation, for which no insurance is available.\\nproduct liability insurance
        could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available
        on commercially reasonable\\nterms, if at all. in addition, we do not maintain
        any product recall insurance, so any product recall we are required to initiate\\ncould
        have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations
        or cash flows. we regularly investigate potential\\nquality issues as part
        of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers.\\n\u00a0\\nbecause
        consumers\\nuse spot products and services in isolated and, in some cases,
        dangerous locations, we cannot predict whether users of the device\\nwho suffer
        injury or death may seek to assert claims against us alleging failure of the
        device to facilitate timely emergency response.\\nalthough we will seek to
        limit our exposure to any such claims through appropriate disclaimers and
        liability insurance coverage,\\nwe cannot assure investors that the disclaimers
        will be effective, claims will not arise or insurance coverage will be sufficient.\\n\u00a0\\nwe
        face intense competition in all of\\nour markets, which could result in a
        loss of customers and lower revenues and make it more difficult for us to
        enter new markets.\\n\u00a0\\nsatellite-based\\ncompetitors\\n\u00a0\\nthere
        are currently\\nthree other mss operators providing services similar to ours
        on a global or regional basis: iridium, thuraya, and inmarsat. the\\nprovision
        of satellite-based products and services is subject to downward price pressure
        when the capacity exceeds demand or as\\nnew competitors enter the marketplace
        with particular competitive pricing strategies.\\n\u00a0\\nother providers
        of\\nsatellite-based products could introduce their own products similar to
        our spot, simplex or duplex products, which may materially\\nadversely affect
        our business plan. in addition, we may face competition from new competitors
        or new technologies. with so many\\ncompanies targeting many of the same customers,
        we may not be able to retain successfully our existing customers and attract
        new\\ncustomers and as a result may not grow our customer base and revenue.\\n\u00a0\\nterrestrial
        competitors\\n\u00a0\\nin addition to our\\nsatellite-based competitors, terrestrial
        wireless voice and data service providers are continuing to expand into rural
        and remote\\nareas, particularly in less developed countries, and providing
        the same general types of services and products that we provide\\nthrough
        our satellite-based system. many of these companies have greater resources,
        greater name recognition and newer technologies\\nthan we do. industry consolidation
        could adversely affect us by increasing the scale or scope of our competitors
        and thereby making\\nit more difficult for us to compete. we could lose market
        share and revenue as a result of increasing competition from the extension\\nof
        land-based communication services.\\n\u00a0\\nalthough satellite\\ncommunications
        services and ground-based communications services are not perfect substitutes,
        the two compete in certain markets\\nand for certain services. consumers generally
        perceive wireless voice communication products and services as cheaper and
        more convenient\\nthan satellite-based products and services.\\n\u00a0\\natc
        competitors\\n\u00a0\\nwe also expect to\\ncompete with a number of other
        satellite companies that plan to develop terrestrial networks that utilize
        their mss spectrum. dish\\nnetworks received fcc approval to offer terrestrial
        wireless services over the mss spectrum that previously belonged to terrestar\\nand
        ico global. further, lightsquared continues its regulatory initiative to receive
        final fcc approval to build out a wireless\\nnetwork utilizing its mss spectrum.
        any of these competitors could offer an integrated satellite and terrestrial
        network before\\nwe do, could combine with terrestrial networks that provide
        them with greater financial or operational flexibility than we have,\\nor
        could offer wireless services, including mobile broadband services, that customers
        prefer over ours.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n19\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\npotential loss of
        customers\\n\u00a0\\nwe may lose customers\\ndue to competition, consolidation,
        regulatory developments, disruptive technologies, business developments affecting
        our customers\\nor their customers, the degradation of our constellation or
        for other reasons. our top 10 customers for the year ended december\\n31,
        2013 accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 12% of our total revenues.
        for the year ended december 31, 2013, revenues\\nfrom our largest customer
        were $2.2 million or 3% of our total revenues. if we fail to maintain our
        relationships with our major\\ncustomers, if we lose them and fail to replace
        them with other similar customers, or if we experience reduced demand from
        our major\\ncustomers, our revenue could be significantly reduced. in addition,
        we may incur additional costs to the extent that amounts due\\nfrom these
        customers become uncollectible. more generally, our customers may fail to
        renew or may cancel their service contracts\\nwith us, which could negatively
        affect future revenues and profitability.\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0we face special\\nrisks
        by doing business in developing markets, including currency and expropriation
        risks, which could increase our costs or reduce\\nour revenues in these areas.\\n\u00a0\\nalthough
        our most\\neconomically important geographic markets currently are the united

        services in, and our business plan includes, developing countries or regions
        that are underserved by existing telecommunications\\nsystems, such as rural
        venezuela, brazil and central america. developing countries are more likely
        than industrialized countries\\nto experience market, currency and interest
        rate fluctuations and may have higher inflation. in addition, these countries
        present\\nrisks relating to government policy, price, wage and exchange controls,
        social instability, expropriation and other adverse economic,\\npolitical
        and diplomatic conditions.\\n\u00a0\\nwe receive a majority\\nof our revenues
        in u.s. dollars. limited availability of u.s. currency in some local markets
        or governmental controls on the export\\nof currency may prevent an igo from
        making payments in u.s. dollars or delay the availability of payment due to
        foreign bank currency\\nprocessing and approval. in addition, exchange rate
        fluctuations may affect our ability to control the prices charged for the
        independent\\ngateway operators'' services.\\n\u00a0\\nour operations involve\\ntransactions
        in a variety of currencies. sales denominated in foreign currencies involve
        primarily the canadian dollar, the euro,\\nand the brazilian real. certain
        of our obligations are denominated in euros. accordingly, our operating results
        may be significantly\\naffected by fluctuations in the exchange rates for
        these currencies. approximately 32% and 29% of our total sales were to retail\\ncustomers
        located primarily in canada, europe, central america, and south america during
        2013 and 2012, respectively. our results\\nof operations for 2013 and 2012
        included losses of $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, on foreign
        currency transactions.\\nwe may be unable to offset unfavorable currency movements
        as they adversely affect our revenue and expenses. our inability to do\\nso
        could have a substantial negative impact on our operating results and cash
        flows.\\n\u00a0\\npursuing strategic transactions may\\ncause us to incur
        additional risks.\\n\u00a0\\nwe may pursue acquisitions,\\njoint ventures
        or other strategic transactions on an opportunistic basis. we may face costs
        and risks arising from any such transactions,\\nincluding integrating a new
        business into our business or managing a joint venture. these may include
        legal, organizational, financial\\nand other costs and risks.\\n\u00a0\\nin
        addition, if we\\nwere to choose to engage in any major business combination
        or similar strategic transaction, we may require significant external\\nfinancing
        in connection with the transaction. depending on market conditions, investor
        perceptions of us, and other factors, we\\nmay not be able to obtain capital
        on acceptable terms, in acceptable amounts or at appropriate times to implement
        any such transaction.\\nour facility agreement and other debt obligations
        contain covenants which limit our ability to engage in specified forms of
        capital\\ntransactions without lender consent, which may be impossible to
        obtain. any such financing, if obtained, may further dilute our\\nexisting
        stockholders.\\n\u00a0\\nour revenues are subject to changes\\nin global economic
        conditions and consumer sentiment and discretionary spending. \\n\u00a0\\nfinancial
        markets\\ncontinue to be uncertain and could significantly adversely impact
        global economic conditions. these conditions could lead to further\\nreduced
        consumer spending in the foreseeable future, especially for discretionary
        travel and related products. a substantial portion\\nof the potential addressable
        market for our consumer retail products and services relates to recreational
        users, such as mountain\\nclimbers, campers, kayakers, sport fishermen and
        wilderness hikers. these potential customers may reduce their activities or
        their\\nspending due to economic conditions, which could adversely affect
        our business, financial condition, results of operations and\\nliquidity.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n20\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\u00a0\\nchanges

        trade could adversely affect our sourcing.\\n\u00a0\\nwe source our products\\nprimarily
        from foreign contract manufacturers, with the largest concentration being
        in china. the adoption of regulations related\\nto the importation of product,
        including quotas, duties, taxes and other charges or restrictions on imported
        goods, and changes\\nin u.s. customs procedures could result in an increase
        in the cost of our products. delays in customs clearance of goods or the\\ndisruption
        of international transportation lines used by us could result in our inability
        to deliver goods to customers in a timely\\nmanner or the potential loss of
        sales altogether. current or future social and environmental regulations or
        critical issues, such\\nas those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals
        from the democratic republic of the congo or the need to eliminate environmentally\\nsensitive
        materials from our products, could restrict the supply of components and materials
        used in production or increase our\\ncosts. any delay or interruption to our
        manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue,
        which would\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, or results
        of operations.\\n\u00a0\\nchanges in tax rates or adverse results\\nof tax
        examinations could materially increase our costs.\\n\u00a0\\nwe operate in
        various u.s. and foreign\\ntax jurisdictions. the process of determining our
        anticipated tax liabilities involves many calculations and estimates which
        are\\ninherently complex. we believe that we have complied in all material
        respects with our obligations to pay taxes in these jurisdictions.\\nhowever,
        our position is subject to review and possible challenge by the taxing authorities
        of these jurisdictions. if the applicable\\ntaxing authorities were to challenge
        successfully our current tax positions, or if there were changes in the manner
        in which we\\nconduct our activities, we could become subject to material
        unanticipated tax liabilities. we may also become subject to additional\\ntax
        liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws, which could in certain circumstances
        have a retroactive effect.\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0in january 2012 our canadian subsidiary\\nwas
        notified that its income tax returns for the years ending october 31, 2008

        a result of our acquisition of\\nan independent gateway operator in brazil
        during 2008, we are exposed to potential pre-acquisition tax liabilities.
        during 2013,\\nthe seller paid approximately $0.3 million of these liabilities,
        but the gateway operator remains subject to an additional $2.2\\nmillion in
        liabilities. we may be exposed to potential pre-acquisition liabilities for
        which we may not be fully indemnified by\\nthe seller, or the seller may fail
        to perform its indemnification obligations.\\n\u00a0\\nour variable rate indebtedness
        subjects\\nus to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations
        to increase significantly.\\n\u00a0\\nborrowings under our\\nfacility agreement
        are at a variable rate. in order to mitigate our variable rate interest risk,
        we entered into a ten year interest\\nrate cap agreement. the interest rate
        cap agreements reflect a variable notional amount ranging from $586.3 million
        to $14.8 million\\nat interest rates that provide coverage to us for exposure
        resulting from escalating interest rates over the term of the facility\\nagreement.
        the interest rate cap provides limits on the six-month libor rate (\u201cbase
        rate\u201d) used to calculate the coupon\\ninterest on outstanding amounts
        on the facility agreement. our interest rate is capped at 5.50% if the base
        rate does not exceed\\n6.5%. should the base rate exceed 6.5%, our base rate
        will be 1% less than the then six-month libor rate. regardless of our attempts\\nto
        mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the interest rate
        cap, we still have exposure for the uncapped amounts\\nof the facility, which
        remain subject to a variable interest rate. as a result, an increase in interest
        rates could result in a\\nsubstantial increase in interest expense, especially
        as the capped amount of the term loan decreases over time.\\n\u00a0\\nthe

        disaster were to impair\\nor destroy any of our ground facilities, we might
        be unable to provide service to our customers in the affected area for a period\\nof
        time. even if our gateways are not affected by natural disasters, our service
        could be disrupted if a natural disaster damages\\nthe public switch telephone
        network or terrestrial wireless networks or our ability to connect to the

        17, 2007, thermo assumed all of the obligations and was assigned all of\\nthe
        rights (other than indemnification rights) of the administrative agent and
        the lenders under our amended and restated credit\\nagreement. to fulfill
        the conditions precedent to our facility agreement, in 2009, thermo converted
        the loans outstanding under\\nthe credit agreement into equity and terminated
        the credit agreement. in addition, thermo and its affiliates deposited $60.0
        million\\nin a contingent equity account to fulfill a condition precedent
        for borrowing under the facility agreement, purchased $20.0 million\\nof our
        5.0% notes, which were subsequently converted into shares of common stock
        in 2013, purchased $11.4 million of our 8.00%\\nnotes issued in 2013, and
        loaned us $37.5 million to fund our debt service reserve account under the
        facility agreement. on may\\n20, 2013, we issued 8.00% notes issued in 2013
        in exchange for 5.75% notes. in connection with this exchange, we entered
        into the\\nconsent agreement, the common stock purchase agreement, and the
        common stock purchase and option agreement. during 2013, thermo\\nand its

        approximately cad 2.5 billion of this total\\nborrowing capacity is debt that
        is secured by substantially all of the assets of telesat. this indebtedness

        on telesat\u2019s activities. these restrictions on telesat\u2019s ability
        to operate its business could seriously\\nharm its business by, among other

        by the government of canada, we are still subject to our shareholders agreement
        with the\\npublic sector pension investment board (\u201cpsp\u201d) and the
        articles of incorporation of telesat holdco, which do not allow\\nus to own

        in its 10-member board of directors, comprised of three loral-appointed directors,

        for directors and 67.3%\\nof the voting interests for all other matters, together
        own a majority of telesat\u2019s voting power, circumstances may occur\\nwhere
        our interests and those of psp diverge or are in conflict. for example, it

        it has deferred certain payments owed to us, hisdesat and telesat,\\nincluding
        payments due under an agreement with hisdesat to lease certain transponders
        on the spainsat satellite. these lease obligations\\nwere $25 million in 2013
        with increases thereafter to a maximum of $28 million per year through the
        end of the useful life of the\\nsatellite, which is estimated to be in 2022.
        in addition, xtar has entered into an agreement with hisdesat whereby the
        past due\\nbalance on the spainsat transponders of $32.3 million as of december
        31, 2008, together with a deferral of $6.7 million in payments\\ndue in 2009,
        became payable to hisdesat over 12 years through annual payments of $5 million.
        xtar\u2019s lease and other obligations\\nto hisdesat, which will aggregate
        in excess of $376 million over the life of the satellite, are substantial,
        especially in light\\nof xtar\u2019s limited revenues to date. xtar has agreed

        payments on these obligations, as well as payments of other amounts owed to
        us, hisdesat and telesat in respect of services\\nprovided by them to xtar.
        unless xtar is able to generate a substantial increase in its revenues, these

        complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and therefore
        are subject to significant operational risks\\nwhile in orbit. the risks include
        in-orbit equipment failures, malfunctions and other kinds of problems commonly
        referred to as\\nanomalies. satellite anomalies include, for example, circuit
        failures, transponder failures, solar array failures, telemetry transmitter\\nfailures,
        battery cell and other power system failures, satellite control system failures
        and propulsion system failures. some\\nof telesat\u2019s satellites have had
        malfunctions and other anomalies in the past. acts of war, terrorism, magnetic,
        electrostatic\\nor solar storms, space debris, satellite conjunctions or micrometeoroids
        could also damage telesat\u2019s satellites.\\n\u00a0\\ndespite working closely\\nwith
        satellite manufacturers to determine the causes of anomalies and mitigate
        them in new satellites and to provide for intrasatellite\\nredundancies for
        certain critical components to minimize or eliminate service disruptions in
        the event of failure, anomalies are\\nlikely to be experienced in the future,
        whether due to the types of anomalies described above or arising from the
        failure of other\\nsystems or components, and intrasatellite redundancy may
        not be available upon the occurrence of such anomalies. there can be no\\nassurance
        that, in these cases, it will be possible to restore normal operations. where
        service cannot be restored, the failure\\ncould cause the satellite to have
        less capacity available for sale, to suffer performance degradation, or to
        cease operating prematurely,\\neither in whole or in part. for example, if
        the damaged solar array on telstar 14r/estrela do sul 2 were to deploy unexpectedly\\nin
        the future, this could result in a loss of capability to provide service.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n19\\ntable

        failure (whether full or partial) of any of telesat\u2019s satellites could
        cause telesat\u2019s\\nrevenues, cash flows and backlog to decline materially,
        could require telesat to repay prepayments made by customers of the affected\\nsatellite
        and could have a material adverse effect on telesat\u2019s relationships with
        current customers and its ability to attract\\nnew customers for satellite
        services. a failure could result in a customer terminating its contract for
        service on the affected\\nsatellite. if telesat is unable to provide alternate
        capacity to an affected customer, the customer may decide to procure all or\\na
        portion of its future satellite services from an alternate supplier or the
        customer\u2019s business may be so adversely affected\\nby the satellite failure
        that it may not have the financial ability to procure future satellite services.
        in addition, an anomaly\\nthat has a material adverse effect on a satellite\u2019s
        overall performance or expected orbital maneuver life could require telesat\\nto
        recognize an impairment loss, which in turn would adversely affect us. it
        may also require telesat to expedite its planned replacement\\nprogram, adversely
        affecting its profitability and increasing its financing needs and limiting
        the availability of funds for other\\nbusiness purposes. finally, the occurrence
        of anomalies may adversely affect telesat\u2019s ability to insure satellites
        at commercially\\nreasonable premiums, if at all, and may cause insurers to
        demand additional exclusions in policies they issue.\\n\u00a0\\nthe actual

        anticipates\\nthat its satellites will have the end of orbital maneuver life
        dates described above in item1-business. for all but one of telesat\u2019s\\nsatellites,
        the expected end-of orbital maneuver life date goes beyond the manufacturer\u2019s
        end-of-service life date. a number\\nof factors will affect the actual commercial

        amount of propellant used in maintaining the satellite\u2019s orbital location
        or relocating\\nthe satellite to a new orbital location (and, for newly-launched

        in technology which may make all or a portion of telesat\u2019s satellite
        fleet obsolete.\\n\u00a0\\ntelesat has been forced\\nto remove satellites
        from service prematurely in the past due to an unexpected reduction in their
        previously anticipated end-of-orbital\\nmaneuver life. it is possible that
        the actual orbital maneuver lives of one or more of telesat\u2019s existing
        satellites may\\nalso be shorter than originally anticipated. further, on
        some of telesat\u2019s satellites it is anticipated that the total available\\npayload
        capacity may need to be reduced prior to the satellite reaching its end-of-orbital
        maneuver life.\\n\u00a0\\ntelesat periodically\\nreviews the expected orbital
        maneuver lives of each of its satellites using current engineering data. a
        reduction in the orbital\\nmaneuver life of any of telesat\u2019s satellites
        could result in a reduction of the revenues generated by that satellite, the\\nrecognition
        of an impairment loss and an acceleration of capital expenditures. to the
        extent telesat is required to reduce the\\navailable payload capacity prior
        to the end of a satellite\u2019s orbital maneuver life, its revenues from
        the satellite would\\nbe reduced.\\n\u00a0\\ntelesat\u2019s satellite launches
        may\\nbe delayed, it may suffer launch failures or its satellites may fail
        to reach their planned orbital locations. any such issue could\\nresult in
        the loss of a satellite or cause significant delays in the deployment of the
        satellite which could have a material adverse\\neffect on telesat\u2019s results
        of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\\n\u00a0\\ndelays
        in launching\\nsatellites and in the deployment of satellites are not uncommon
        and result from construction delays, the unavailability of reliable\\nlaunch
        opportunities with suppliers, delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals
        and launch failures.\u00a0if satellite construction\\nschedules are not met,
        a launch opportunity may not be available at the time the satellite is ready
        to be launched.\u00a0satellites\\nare also subject to certain risks related
        to failed launches. launch vehicles may fail. launch failures result in significant
        delays\\nin the deployment of satellites because of the need to construct
        replacement satellites, which typically takes up to 30 months\\nor longer,
        and to obtain another launch vehicle. a delay or perceived delay in launching
        a satellite, or replacing a satellite,\\nmay cause telesat\u2019s current
        customers to move to another satellite provider if they determine that the
        delay may cause an\\ninterruption in continuous service. in addition, telesat\u2019s
        contracts with customers who purchase or reserve satellite capacity\\nmay
        allow the customers to terminate their contracts in the event of a delay.
        any such termination would require telesat to refund\\nany prepayment it may
        have received, and would result in a reduction in telesat\u2019s contracted
        backlog and would delay or prevent\\ntelesat from securing the commercial
        benefits of the new satellite. launch vehicles may also underperform, in which
        case the satellite\\nmay be lost or, if it can be placed into service by using

        or radio frequency interference and other similar potential risks for which
        exclusions\\nare customary in the industry at the time the policy is written.

        competitors who are substantially larger than telesat in terms of\\nboth the
        number of satellites they have in orbit as well as in terms of their revenues.
        due to their larger sizes, these operators\\nare able to take advantage of

        on the specific satellite\\nand orbital location in question) have greater
        flexibility to restore service to their customers in the event of a partial
        or total\\nsatellite failure and may be able to offer expansion capacity for

        who may enjoy competitive advantages in their local markets. as a condition
        of telesat\u2019s licenses for certain satellites,\\ntelesat is required by
        industry canada, the governmental department overseeing canadian investment
        innovation and economic development,\\nto invest in research and development
        related to satellite communication activities. telesat\u2019s global competitors
        may not\\nface this additional financial burden.\\n\u00a0\\ntelesat expects
        a\\nsubstantial portion of its ongoing business will continue to be in the
        canadian domestic market. this market is characterized by\\nincreasing competition
        among satellite providers and rapid technological development. historically,
        the canadian regulatory framework\\nhas required the use of canadian-licensed
        satellites for the delivery of dth programming in canada. it is possible that
        this framework\\ncould change and allow non-canadian satellite operators that
        have adequate service coverage in canadian territory to compete for\\nfuture
        business from telesat\u2019s dth customers. in 2007, industry canada awarded
        a spectrum which is suitable for providing\\nservices to canadian customers,
        including dth, to ciel satellite group which was at the time canadian controlled
        but has since\\nbecome controlled by a foreign entity, ses s.a. the world\u2019s

        business\\nis also subject to competition from ground based forms of communications
        technology. for many point-to-point and other services,\\nthe offerings provided
        by terrestrial companies can be more competitive than the services offered
        via satellite. a number of companies\\nare increasing their ability to transmit
        signals on existing terrestrial infrastructures, such as fiber optic cable,
        dsl (digital\\nsubscriber line) and terrestrial wireless transmitters often
        with funding and other incentives provided by government. the ability\\nof
        any of these companies to significantly increase their capacity and/or the
        reach of their network likely would result in a decrease\\nin the demand for
        telesat\u2019s services. increasing availability of capacity from other forms
        of communications technology can\\ncreate an excess supply of telecommunications
        capacity, decreasing the prices telesat would be able to charge for its services\\nunder
        new service contracts and thereby negatively affecting telesat\u2019s profitability.
        new technology could render satellite-based\\nservices less competitive by
        satisfying consumer demand in other ways. telesat also competes for local
        regulatory approval in places\\nwhere more than one provider may want to operate
        and with other satellite operators for scarce frequency assignments and a
        limited\\nsupply of orbital locations. telesat\u2019s failure to compete effectively
        could result in a loss of revenues and a decline in\\nprofitability, a decrease
        in the value of its business and a downgrade of its credit rating, which would
        restrict its access to\\nthe capital markets.\\n\u00a0\\nfluctuations in available
        satellite\\ncapacity could adversely affect telesat\u2019s results. \\n\u00a0\\nthe
        availability of\\nsatellite capacity has fluctuated over time, characterized
        by periods of undersupply of capacity, followed by periods of substantial\\nnew
        satellite construction which is, in turn, followed by an oversupply of available
        capacity. to the extent telesat were to experience\\nanother period of oversupply
        of capacity as a result of new satellite construction or otherwise, it may
        be forced to decrease the\\nprices it charges for services which would adversely
        affect its results.\\n\u00a0\\nreductions in government spending could\\nreduce
        demand for telesat\u2019s services. \\n\u00a0\\ngovernments, in particular\\nthe
        u.s. government, purchase a substantial amount of satellite services from
        commercial satellite operators, including telesat.\\nto the extent these governments
        reduce spending on satellite services, as a result of the need to reduce overall
        spending during\\nperiods of fiscal restraint, to reduce budget deficits or
        otherwise, demand for telesat\u2019s services could decrease which could\\nadversely
        affect telesat\u2019s revenue, the prices it is able to charge for services
        and its results.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n22\\ntable of contents\\n\\n\u00a0\\nchanges

        or the improvement of existing technologies may reduce the transponder capacity

        the growth of ott distribution may have a negative impact on the\\ndemand

        addition to regulatory\\nrequirements governing the use of orbital locations,
        most countries regulate transmission of signals to and from their territory,\\nand

        in particular,\\ntelesat may not be able to obtain all of the required regulatory
        authorizations for the construction, launch and operation of any\\nof its
        future satellites, for the orbital locations and spectrum for these satellites
        and for its ground infrastructure, on acceptable\\nterms or at all. even if

        operations may be limited\\nor precluded by itu rules or processes, and telesat

        international\\ntelecommunication union (\u201citu\u201d), a specialized united
        nations agency, regulates the global allocation of radio frequency\\nspectrum
        and the registration of radio frequency assignments and any associated orbital
        location in the geostationary satellite\\norbit. telesat participates in the
        activities of the itu. only national administrations, however, have full standing
        as itu members.\\nconsequently, telesat must rely on the relevant government
        administrations to represent its interests.\\n\u00a0\\nthe itu establishes\\nthe
        radio regulations, an international treaty which contains the rules concerning
        frequency allocations and the priority to, coordination\\nof, and use of,
        radio frequency assignments. the itu radio regulations define the allocation
        of radio frequencies to specific uses.\\nthe itu radio regulations are periodically
        reviewed and revised at world radiocommunication conferences (\u2018\u2018wrc\u2019\u2019),\\nwhich
        take place typically every three to four years. as a result, telesat cannot
        guarantee that the itu will not change its allocation\\ndecisions and rules
        in the future in a way that could limit or preclude telesat\u2019s use of
        some or all of its existing or future\\norbital locations or spectrum.\\n\u00a0\\nthe
        itu radio regulations\\nalso establish operating procedures for satellite
        networks and prescribe detailed coordination, notification and recording procedures.\\nwith
        respect to the frequencies used by commercial geostationary satellites, the
        itu radio regulations set forth a process for\\nprotecting earlier-registered
        satellite systems from interference from later-registered satellite systems.
        in order to comply with\\nthese rules, telesat must coordinate the operation
        of its satellites, including any replacement satellite that has performance\\ncharacteristics
        that are different from those of the satellite it replaces, with other satellites.
        this process requires potentially\\nlengthy and costly negotiations with parties
        who operate or intend to operate satellites that could affect or be affected
        by telesat\u2019s\\nsatellites. for example, as part of telesat\u2019s coordination
        effort on telstar 12, telesat agreed to provide four 54 mhz transponders\\non
        telstar 12 to eutelsat s.a. (\u201ceutelsat\u201d) for the life of the satellite
        and has retained risk of loss with respect\\nto those transponders. telesat
        also granted eutelsat the right to acquire, at cost, four transponders on
        the replacement satellite\\nfor telstar 12. telesat has leased back from eutelsat
        three of the four transponders to provide service to its customers. in addition,\\nthe
        russian satellite communications company (\u201crscc\u201d) is launching a
        satellite to operate at 14\u00b0 wl, adjacent to\\nthe location of telesat\u2019s
        telstar 12 at 15\u00b0 wl. in the fourth quarter of 2013, telesat resolved
        a longstanding coordination\\nissue with rscc regarding priority rights over
        certain frequencies. pursuant to its coordination agreement with rscc, telesat
        will\\nbe required to cease using certain frequencies on its telesat 12 satellite
        as soon as rscc\u2019s satellite is launched and commences\\nservice, which
        will require telesat to relocate some of its customers on to alternate frequencies.\\n\u00a0\\nin
        certain countries,\\na failure to resolve coordination issues is used by regulators
        as a justification to limit or condition market access by foreign\\nsatellite
        operators. in addition, while the itu radio regulations require later-in-time
        systems to coordinate their operations\\nwith telesat, telesat cannot guarantee
        that other operators will conduct their operations so as to avoid transmitting
        any signals\\nthat would cause harmful interference to the signals that telesat,
        or its customers, transmit. this interference could require\\ntelesat to take
        steps, or pay or refund amounts to its customers, that could have a material
        adverse effect on telesat\u2019s\\nresults of operations, business prospects
        and financial condition. the itu\u2019s radio regulations do not contain mandatory
        dispute\\nresolution or enforcement regulations and neither the itu specifically,
        nor international law generally, provides clear remedies\\nif the itu coordination
        process fails. failure to coordinate telesat\u2019s satellites\u2019 frequencies
        successfully or to obtain\\nor maintain other required regulatory approvals
        could have an adverse effect on telesat\u2019s business operations, prospects\\nand
        financial condition, as well as on the value of its business.\\n\u00a0\\nif
        telesat does not occupy unused orbital\\nlocations by specified deadlines,
        or does not maintain satellites in orbital locations it currently uses, those
        orbital locations\\nmay become available for other satellite operators to
        use. \\n\u00a0\\ntelesat\u2019s in-orbit\\nsatellites do not currently occupy
        all of the orbital locations for which it has obtained regulatory authorizations.
        in some cases,\\nthe telesat satellite that occupies an orbital location is
        not designed to use all of the frequencies for which telesat has been\\nauthorized.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n25\\ntable
        of contents\\n\\n\u00a0\\nin accordance with\\nthe itu radio regulations,
        governments have rights to use certain orbital locations and frequencies.
        certain of these governments\\nhave in turn authorized telesat to use several
        orbital locations and radio frequencies in addition to those used by its current\\nsatellites.
        under the itu radio regulations, telesat must bring into use (\u201cbiu\u201d)
        these orbital locations and frequencies\\nwithin a fixed period of time, or
        the governments in question would lose their priority rights and the orbital
        location, and frequencies\\nlikely would become available for use by another
        satellite operator. prior to the wrc which took place in february 2012, the
        itu\\nradio regulations did not expressly address the manner of use or duration
        of use required to biu an orbital location. at the 2012\\nwrc the itu radio
        regulations were amended to expressly require, among other things, a minimum
        duration that a suitable satellite\\nmust be deployed and maintained at an
        orbital location to biu frequency assignments at that location. in view of
        these requirements,\\nit may be more difficult and/or costly to preserve unused
        orbital locations and frequencies and telesat may not be able to do so.\\nin
        addition, the governments that have authorized telesat to use these orbital
        locations have generally conditioned such use on\\ntelesat meeting certain
        milestones, including making use of the orbital location by a specified time.
        if telesat is unable to place\\nsatellites into currently unused orbital locations
        by specified deadlines and in a manner that satisfies the itu radio regulations,\\nnational
        regulatory requirements, if the itu and national regulation or requirements
        were to change, or if telesat is unable to\\nmaintain satellites at the orbital
        locations that it currently uses, telesat may lose its rights to use these
        orbital locations\\nand the locations could become available for other satellite
        operators to use. the loss of one or more of telesat\u2019s orbital\\nlocations
        could negatively affect its plans and its ability to implement its business
        strategy.\\n\u00a0\\ntelesat\u2019s business is capital\\nintensive, and telesat
        may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance its business strategies,
        or telesat may be able to\\ndo so only on terms that significantly restrict
        its ability to operate its business.\\n\u00a0\\nimplementation of\\ntelesat\u2019s
        business strategy requires a substantial outlay of capital. as telesat pursues
        its business strategies and seeks\\nto respond to developments in its business
        and opportunities and trends in its industry, its actual capital expenditures
        may differ\\nfrom its expected capital expenditures. there can be no assurance
        that telesat will be able to satisfy its capital requirements\\nin the future.
        in addition, if one of telesat\u2019s satellites failed unexpectedly, there
        can be no assurance of insurance recovery\\nor the timing thereof and telesat
        may need to exhaust or significantly draw upon its revolving credit facility
        or obtain additional\\nfinancing to replace the satellite. if telesat determines
        that it needs to obtain additional funds through external financing and\\nis
        unable to do so, telesat may be prevented from fully implementing its business
        strategy.\\n\u00a0\\nthe availability and\\ncost to telesat of external financing
        depends on a number of factors, including its credit rating and financial
        performance and\\ngeneral market conditions. telesat\u2019s ability to obtain
        financing generally may be influenced by the supply and demand characteristics\\nof
        the telecommunications sector in general and of the fss sector in particular.
        declines in telesat\u2019s expected future revenues\\nunder contracts with
        customers and challenging business conditions faced by its customers are among
        the other factors that may\\nadversely affect telesat\u2019s credit and access
        to the capital markets. other factors that could impact telesat\u2019s credit\\nrating
        include the amount of debt in its current or future capital structure, activities
        associated with strategic initiatives,\\nthe health of its satellites, the
        success or failure of its planned launches, its expected future cash flows
        and the capital expenditures\\nrequired to execute its business strategy.
        the overall impact on telesat\u2019s financial condition of any transaction
        that it\\npursues may be negative or may be negatively perceived by the financial
        markets and rating agencies and may result in adverse rating\\nagency actions
        with respect to its credit rating and access to the capital markets. long-term
        disruptions in the capital or credit\\nmarkets as a result of uncertainty
        or recession, changing or increased regulation or failures of significant
        financial institutions\\ncould adversely affect telesat\u2019s access to capital.
        a credit rating downgrade or deterioration in telesat\u2019s financial\\nperformance
        or general market conditions could limit its ability to obtain financing or
        could result in any such financing being\\navailable only at greater cost
        or on more restrictive terms than might otherwise be available and, in either
        case, could result\\nin telesat deferring or reducing capital expenditures
        including on new or replacement satellites. in certain circumstances, telesat\\nis
        required to obtain the approval of its shareholders to incur additional indebtedness.
        there can be no assurances that telesat\\nwill receive such approval, if required.\\n\u00a0\\nmarket
        conditions may make it difficult\\nfor telesat to extend the maturity of or
        refinance its existing indebtedness, and any failure to do so could have a
        material adverse\\neffect on its business. \\n\u00a0\\nas of december 31,\\n2013,

        partial or total loss of one or more of these facilities due to natural disasters
        (tornado, flood, hurricane or other such acts\\nof god), fire, acts of war
        or terrorism or other catastrophic events. a failure at any of these facilities
        would cause a significant\\nloss of service for telesat customers. additionally,
        telesat may experience a failure in the necessary equipment at the satellite\\ncontrol
        center, at the back-up facility, or in the communication links between these
        facilities and remote earth station facilities.\\na failure or operator error
        affecting tracking, telemetry and control operations might lead to a break-down
        in the ability to communicate\\nwith one or more satellites or cause the transmission
        of incorrect instructions to the affected satellite(s), which could lead\\nto
        a temporary or permanent degradation in satellite performance or to the loss
        of one or more satellites. intentional or non-intentional\\nelectromagnetic
        or radio frequency interference could result in a failure of telesat\u2019s
        ability to deliver satellite services\\nto its customers. a failure at any
        of telesat\u2019s facilities or in the communications links between its facilities
        or interference\\nwith its satellite signal could cause its revenues and backlog
        to decline materially and could adversely affect its ability to\\nmarket its
        services and generate future revenues and profit.\\n\u00a0\\ntelesat purchases\\nequipment
        from third party suppliers and depends on those suppliers to deliver, maintain
        and support these products to the contracted\\nspecifications in order for
        telesat to meet its service commitments to its customers. telesat may experience
        difficulty if these\\nsuppliers do not meet their obligations to deliver and
        support this equipment. telesat may also experience difficulty or failure\\nwhen
        implementing, operating and maintaining this equipment or when providing services
        using this equipment. this difficulty or\\nfailure may lead to delays in implementing
        services, service interruptions or degradations in service, which could cause
        telesat\u2019s\\nrevenues and backlog to decline materially and could adversely
        affect telesat\u2019s ability to market its services and generate\\nfuture
        revenues and profit.\\n\u00a0\\ntelesat\u2019s dependence on outside\\ncontractors
        could result in delays related to the design, manufacture and launch of its
        new satellites, which could in turn adversely\\naffect telesat\u2019s operating
        results and prospects. \\n\u00a0\\nany delays in the design,\\nconstruction
        or launch of telesat\u2019s satellites could have a material adverse effect
        on its business, financial condition\\nand results of operations. there are
        a limited number of manufacturers that are able to design and build satellites
        according to\\nthe technical specifications and standards of quality telesat
        requires, including airbus defense and space, thales alenia space,\\nboeing,
        lockheed martin, orbital and ss/l. there are also a limited number of suppliers
        able to launch such satellites, including\\ninternational launch services,
        arianespace, mitsubishi heavy industries, space x, lockheed martin and sea
        launch. should any of\\ntelesat\u2019s suppliers\u2019 businesses fail, it
        would reduce competition and could increase the cost of satellites and launch\\nservices.
        adverse events with respect to any of telesat\u2019s manufacturers or launch
        suppliers could also result in the delay\\nof the design, construction or
        launch of its satellites. general economic conditions may also affect the
        ability of telesat\u2019s\\nmanufacturers and launch suppliers to provide
        services on commercially reasonable terms or to fulfill their obligations
        in terms\\nof manufacturing schedules, launch dates, pricing or other items.
        even where alternate suppliers for such services are available,\\ntelesat
        may have difficulty identifying them in a timely manner, it may incur significant
        additional expense in changing suppliers,\\nand this could result in difficulties
        or delays in the design, construction or launch of its satellites.\\n\u00a0\\na
        natural disaster could diminish telesat\u2019s\\nability to provide communications
        service. \\n\u00a0\\nnatural disasters could\\ndamage or destroy telesat\u2019s
        ground stations resulting in a disruption of service to its customers. telesat
        has in place certain\\noperational procedures designed to protect its antennas
        and ground stations during natural disasters such as a hurricane, but these\\nprocedures
        may not be sufficient and the collateral effects of such disasters such as
        flooding may impair the functioning of its\\nground equipment and its ability
        to control its satellites. if a future natural disaster impairs or destroys
        any of telesat\u2019s\\nground facilities, telesat may be unable to provide
        service to its customers in the affected area for a period of time.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n27\\ntable

        \\n\u00a0\\nthe assets on telesat\u2019s\\nconsolidated balance sheet as of
        december 31, 2013 include goodwill valued at approximately cad 2,447 million
        and other intangible\\nassets valued at approximately cad 845 million. a valuation
        of goodwill and other intangible assets (such as orbital locations)\\nwith
        indefinite useful lives is undertaken on an annual basis, or whenever events
        or changes in circumstances indicate that the\\ncarrying amount is likely
        to exceed their recoverable amount. telesat measures for impairment using
        a projected discounted cash\\nflow method and confirms the assessment using
        other valuation methods. if the asset\u2019s carrying value is more than its
        recoverable\\namount, the difference is recorded as a reduction in the amount
        of the asset on the balance sheet and an impairment charge in the\\nstatement
        of earnings. testing for impairment requires significant subjective judgments
        by management. any changes in the estimates\\nused could have a material impact
        on the calculation of the recoverable amount and result in an impairment charge.
        telesat cannot\\npredict whether an event that triggers impairment will occur,
        when it will occur or how it will affect the reported asset values.\\nif telesat\u2019s
        goodwill or other intangible assets are deemed to be impaired in whole or
        in part, it could be required to reduce\\nor write off such assets, which

        satellite\\ncapacity for transmissions by third parties. telesat does not
        decide what content is transmitted over its satellites, although\\nits contracts
        generally provide it with rights to prohibit certain types of content or to
        cease transmission or permit telesat\\nto require its customers to cease their
        transmissions under certain circumstances. a governmental body or other entity
        may object\\nto some of the content carried over telesat\u2019s satellites,
        such as \u2018\u2018adult services\u2019\u2019 video channels\\nor content
        deemed political in nature. issues arising from the content of transmissions
        by these third parties over telesat\u2019s\\nsatellites could affect its future

        to provide satellite capacity and related administrative services to certain
        of its customers.\\nviolations of these laws and regulations can also result
        in civil and criminal sanctions or penalties. telesat\u2019s ability\\nto
        acquire new satellites, launch new satellites or operate its satellites could
        also be negatively affected if its suppliers do\\nnot obtain required u.s.
        export authorizations.\\n\u00a0\\ntelesat is subject to risks associated\\nwith
        doing business internationally. \\n\u00a0\\ntelesat\u2019s operations\\ninternationally

        prohibit\\ncompanies and their intermediaries from making improper payments
        to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or\\nretaining
        business. while telesat\u2019s employees are required to comply with these
        laws, telesat cannot be sure that its internal\\npolicies and procedures will
        always protect it from violations of these laws, despite telesat\u2019s commitment
        to legal compliance\\nand corporate ethics. violations of these laws may result
        in severe criminal\\nand civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the

        business of telesat, with its constant technological developments, must continue
        to\\nattract highly qualified and technically skilled employees. in the future,
        the inability to retain or replace these employees,\\nor the inability to
        attract new highly qualified employees, could have a material adverse effect

        take steps to secure information and communications systems, including\\ncomputer
        systems, intranet and internet sites, email and other telecommunications and
        data networks, the security measures implemented\\nhave not always been effective.
        while we and telesat continue to bolster systems with additional security
        measures, and, working\\nwith external experts, mitigate the risk of security
        breaches, systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and interruption\\nfrom

        in addition, telesat\u2019s and our facilities are also potentially vulnerable
        to break-ins, sabotage and intentional\\nacts of vandalism. moreover, some
        of these systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot
        account for all\\neventualities. telesat\u2019s and our business and operations
        could be adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber\\nevent
        or otherwise, operations are disrupted or shut down, confidential or proprietary

        or other costs as a result of any such event. while telesat\u2019s or our
        insurance coverage could offset losses relating\\nto some of these types of
        events, to the extent any such losses are not covered by insurance, a serious
        disruption to systems could\\nsignificantly limit telesat\u2019s or our ability

        common stock and non-voting common stock that would also, if exercised, effectively
        eliminate\\nsuch restrictions. in addition, our board of directors has authorized
        a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the company\\nis authorized to
        purchase up to 800,000 shares of our voting common stock. to the extent the
        company does repurchase shares (through\\n2013, we purchased 154,494 shares

        of\\nthe equity shares of telesat holdco. in the event telesat were to conduct
        a public offering of its equity securities, it is uncertain\\nwhether the
        offering would be a primary offering of shares by telesat, a secondary offering
        of shares by either or both of the\\ntelesat shareholders or a combination
        of both types of offerings. it is also uncertain what effect an offering (and
        any corporate\\nrestructuring required in connection with such offering under
        the terms of the telesat shareholders agreement) would have on loral\u2019s\\ngovernance
        rights in telesat. changes in our telesat governance rights could adversely
        affect the value of our interest in telesat\\nand the price at which our common
        stock trades. in addition, a public market for telesat equity would create
        a situation where\\nthere would be two separate public-market proxies for
        the value of telesat \u2013 our stock and the telesat stock. telesat stock\\nwould
        represent a direct interest in telesat, whereas the value of the common shares
        of loral would also include other assets and\\nliabilities, many of which
        are difficult to value. having both telesat stock and our stock trading publicly
        could create confusion\\nin the market and could adversely affect the liquidity
        and/or trading values of either our or telesat\u2019s common stock.\\n\u00a0\\nchanges
        in tax rates or policies or\\nchanges to our tax liabilities could affect
        operating results.\\n\u00a0\\nwe are subject to u.s.\\nfederal, state and
        local income taxation on our worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain
        income from sources outside the united\\nstates. significant judgment is required
        to determine and estimate our tax liabilities, and our future annual and quarterly
        tax\\nrates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the
        applicable tax laws, composition of earnings in countries\\nor states with
        differing tax rates or our valuation and utilization of deferred tax assets
        and liabilities. in addition, we are\\nsubject to regular examination of our
        income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities.
        although\\nwe believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we regularly evaluate
        the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, and there can\\nbe no assurance
        that any final determination by a taxing authority will not result in additional
        tax liability which could have\\na material adverse effect on our results
        of operations.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n31\\ntable of contents\\n\\n\u00a0\\nthe future
        use of tax attributes is\\nlimited.\\n\u00a0\\nas of december 31,\\n2013,
        we had various tax attributes including federal net operating loss carryforwards,
        or nols, of approximately $290 million,\\nstate nols, primarily new york ($24.1
        million) and california ($77.8 million), and federal and state tax credits,
        that are available\\nto offset future tax liability (see notes 2 and 8 to
        the loral consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting\\ntreatment
        of such tax attributes). as our reorganization on november 21, 2005 constituted
        an \u201cownership change\u201d under\\nsection 382 of the internal revenue
        code, our ability to use these tax attributes existing at such effective date,
        is subject to\\nan annual limitation of approximately $32.6 million, subject
        to increase or decrease based on certain factors. if loral experiences\\nan
        additional \u201cownership change\u201d during any three-year period after
        november 21, 2005, future use of these tax attributes\\nmay become further
        limited. an ownership change may be triggered by sales or acquisitions of
        loral equity interests in excess of\\n50% by shareholders owning five percent
        or more of our total equity value, i.e., the total market value of our equity
        interests,\\nas determined on any applicable testing date. we would be adversely
        affected by an additional \u201cownership change\u201d if,\\nat the time of
        such change, the total market value of our equity multiplied by the federal
        applicable long-term tax exempt rate,\\nwhich at december 31, 2013 was 3.5%,
        was less than $32.6 million. as of december 31, 2013, since the total market
        value of our\\nequity ($2.5 billion) multiplied by the federal applicable
        long-term tax exempt rate was approximately $88 million, an \u201cownership\\nchange\u201d
        as of that date would not have had an adverse effect.\\n\u00a0\\nwe are subject

        the risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the\\nfollowing:
        \\n general risks affecting our business  \\n\\n\\n\u0095we currently derive
        a significant portion of our revenue from our primary customer, dish network
        corporation (\"dish\\nnetwork\"). the loss of, or a significant reduction
        in, orders from, or a decrease in selling prices of digital set-top boxes,
        transponder leasing, provision of digital broadcast services, broadband\\nequipment
        and services and/or other products or services to dish network would significantly
        reduce our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations.  \\n\u0095we
        could face decreased demand and increased pricing pressure to our products
        and services due to competition.  \\n\u0095the average selling price and gross
        margins of our digital set-top boxes have been decreasing and may decrease
        even\\nfurther, which could negatively impact our financial position and results
        of operations. \\n\u0095if significant numbers of television viewers are unwilling
        to pay for pay-tv services that utilize digital set-top boxes,\\nwe may not
        be able to sustain our current revenue level. \\n\u0095we may have unused
        satellite capacity in our echostar satellite services segment, and our results
        of operations may be\\nmaterially adversely affected if we are not able to
        lease this capacity to third parties, including dish network. \\n\u0095the
        failure to adequately anticipate the need for satellite capacity or the inability
        to obtain satellite capacity for our\\nhughes segment could harm our results
        of operations. \\n\u0095we are dependent upon third-party providers for components,
        manufacturing, installation services, and customer support\\nservices, and
        our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if any of these
        third-party providers fail to appropriately deliver the contracted goods or
        services.  \\n\u0095our foreign operations expose us to regulatory risks and
        restrictions not present in our domestic operations.  \\n\u0095we may experience
        significant financial losses on our existing investments.  \\n\u0095we may
        pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to complement or expand
        our business, which may not be\\nsuccessful and we may lose a portion or all
        of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions. \\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\n\\n\\n\u0095we may not be able to generate cash to
        meet our debt service needs or fund our operations.  \\n\u0095covenants in
        hughes satellite systems corporation''s (\"hss\") indentures restrict its
        business in many ways.  \\n\u0095we rely on key personnel and the loss of
        their services may negatively affect our businesses. \\n\\n risks related
        to our satellites  \\n\\n\\n\u0095our owned and leased satellites in orbit
        are subject to significant operational and environmental risks that could
        limit\\nour ability to utilize these satellites. \\n\u0095our satellites have
        minimum design lives ranging from 12 to 15\u00a0years, but could fail or suffer
        reduced capacity\\nbefore then. \\n\u0095our satellites under construction
        are subject to risks related to construction and launch that could limit our
        ability to\\nutilize these satellites. \\n\u0095we generally do not have commercial
        insurance coverage on the satellites we use and could face significant impairment\\ncharges
        if one of our uninsured satellites fails. \\n\u0095our use of certain satellites
        is often dependent on satellite coordination agreements, which may be difficult
        to obtain.  \\n\u0095our dependence on outside contractors could result in
        delays related to the design, manufacture and launch of our new\\nsatellites,
        which could in turn adversely affect our operating results. \\n\\n risks related
        to our products and technology  \\n\\n\\n\u0095if we are unable to properly
        respond to technological changes, our business could be significantly harmed.  \\n\u0095our
        future growth depends on growing demand for advanced technologies. \\n\u0095our
        business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing
        the intellectual property rights of\\nothers. the loss of our intellectual
        property rights or our infringement of the intellectual property rights of
        others could have a significant adverse impact on our business.  \\n\u0095we
        are party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant
        adverse impact on our business,\\nparticularly lawsuits regarding intellectual
        property. \\n\u0095if the encryption and related security technology used
        in our digital set-top boxes is compromised, sales of our digital\\nset-top
        boxes may decline. \\n\u0095we rely on network and information systems and
        other technologies and a disruption, cyber-attack, failure or destruction\\nof
        such networks, systems or technologies may disrupt or harm our business. \\n\u0095if
        our products contain defects, we could be subject to significant costs to
        correct such defects and our product and\\nnetwork service contracts could
        be delayed or cancelled, which could adversely affect our revenue. \\n\\n
        risks related to the regulation of our business  \\n\\n\\n\u0095our business
        is subject to risks of adverse government regulation. \\n\\nii\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\n\\n\\n\u0095our business depends on regulatory authorizations
        issued by the federal communications commission (\"fcc\") and state and\\nforeign
        regulators, that can expire, be revoked or modified, and applications for
        licenses and other authorizations that may not be granted. \\n\u0095our ability
        to sell our digital set-top boxes to certain operators depends on our ability
        to obtain licenses to use the\\nconditional access systems utilized by these
        operators. \\n\u0095we may face difficulties in accurately assessing and collecting
        contributions towards the universal service fund. \\n\\n other risks  \\n\\n\\n\u0095we
        are controlled by one principal stockholder who is our chairman. \\n\u0095we
        have potential conflicts of interest with dish network due to our common ownership
        and management.  \\n\u0095it may be difficult for a third party to acquire
        us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders, because of\\nour
        capital structure. \\n\u0095we may face other risks described from time to

        company that\\nwas organized in october 2007 as a corporation under the laws
        of the state of nevada. in 2008, dish network corporation and its subsidiaries
        (\"dish network\") completed its distribution to us of its\\ndigital set-top
        box business and certain infrastructure and other assets, including certain
        of their satellites, uplink and satellite transmission assets, real estate,
        and other assets and related\\nliabilities to us (the \"spin-off\"). since
        the spin-off, echostar and dish network have operated as separate publicly-traded

        interest in the other (see note\u00a020 of this report for a discussion of
        our subsequent events). however, a substantial majority of the voting power
        of the shares of both companies is\\nbeneficially owned by charles\u00a0w.
        ergen, our chairman, and by certain trusts established by mr.\u00a0ergen for
        the benefit of his family. our class\u00a0a common stock is publicly traded
        on\\nthe nasdaq global select market (\"nasdaq\") under the symbol \"sats.\"
        we are a global provider of satellite operations, video delivery solutions,
        digital set-top boxes, and broadband satellite\\ntechnologies and services
        for home and office, delivering innovative network technologies, managed services,
        and solutions for enterprises and governments. \\nwe\\ncurrently operate in
        three business segments. \\n\\n\\n\u0095echostar technologies\u0097which designs,
        develops and distributes\\ndigital set-top boxes and related products and
        technology, primarily for satellite tv service providers, telecommunication
        companies and international cable companies. our echostar technologies\\nsegment
        also provides digital broadcast operations, including satellite uplinking/downlinking,
        transmission services, signal processing, conditional access management, and
        other services, primarily to\\ndish network. in addition, we provide our slingboxes
        directly to consumers via retail outlets and online. \\n\u0095hughes\u0097which
        provides satellite broadband internet access to\\nnorth american consumers
        and broadband network services and equipment to domestic and international
        enterprise markets. the hughes segment also provides managed services to large
        enterprises and\\nsolutions to customers for mobile satellite systems. \\n\u0095echostar
        satellite services\u0097which uses certain of our owned\\nand leased in-orbit
        satellites and related licenses to lease capacity on a full-time and occasional-use
        basis primarily to dish network and secondarily to dish mexico, s. de r.l.
        de c.v. (\"dish\\nmexico\"), a joint venture that we entered into in 2008,
        as well as united states (\"u.s.\") government service providers, state agencies,
        internet service providers, broadcast news organizations,\\nprogrammers, and
        private enterprise customers. \\n\\nour\\noperations also include real estate
        and other activities that have not been assigned to our operating segments,
        costs incurred in business development activities, expenses of various corporate\\ndepartments,
        and our centralized treasury activities, including income from our investment
        portfolio and interest expense on our debt. \\n business strategies  \\n capitalize
        on demand for broadband services.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we intend to capitalize
        on the demand for satellite-delivered broadband services and enterprise solutions
        by\\nutilizing, among other things, our industry expertise, technology leadership,
        satellite capacity, and high-quality, reliable service to continue growth
        in consumer subscribers and the enterprise\\nmarket. \\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable

        expertise in the identification, acquisition and development of satellite
        spectrum rights and satellite\\noperations, together with existing or acquired
        infrastructure will provide opportunities to cross sell services, bundle satellite
        broadband and video services, and explore opportunities in new\\nmarkets.
        we believe market opportunities exist that will facilitate the acquisition
        or leasing of satellite capacity which will enable us to provide services
        to a broader customer base, including\\nproviders of pay-tv services, satellite-delivered
        broadband, corporate communications, and government services. \\n exploit
        international opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we believe that direct-to-home
        (\"dth\") satellite and broadband services are particularly well-suited for
        countries without\\nextensive telecommunications and cable infrastructure.
        we intend to selectively pursue partnerships, joint ventures and strategic
        acquisition opportunities that allow us to capitalize on our extensive\\nexperience
        in delivering end-to-end broadband and pay-tv consumer services. \\n expand

        broader adoption of advanced technologies such as whole home dvr, placeshifting
        for tvanywhere, hybrid internet offerings and other in-home\\nsolutions to
        create opportunities for us. therefore, we continue to explore opportunities,
        including partnerships, joint ventures and strategic acquisitions, to expand
        our existing markets or enter\\nnew markets. in addition, we intend to seek
        opportunities to license our technology to other original equipment manufacturers

        customer of our echostar technologies segment has been dish network. dish
        network accounted for 90.1%, 76.9% and 79.4% of\\nour total echostar technologies
        segment revenue for the years ended december\u00a031, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
        respectively. bell tv, a dth satellite service provider in canada, accounted
        for 4.5%,\\n13.4% and 12.3% of our total echostar technologies segment revenue
        for the years ended december\u00a031, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. we
        also currently sell our digital set-top boxes to other\\ninternational dth
        satellite and cable providers, including dish mexico. \\nwe\\nexpect dish
        network will continue to be the primary customer and the key revenue contributor
        for our echostar technologies segment. effective january\u00a01, 2012, we
        entered into a receiver\\nagreement, expiring on december\u00a031, 2014, with
        dish network pursuant to which dish network has the right, but not the obligation,
        to purchase digital set-top boxes, related accessories, and\\nother equipment
        from us either: (i)\u00a0at cost (decreasing as we reduce costs and increasing
        as our costs increase) plus a dollar mark-up which will depend upon the cost
        of the product subject to\\na collar on\\nour mark-up; or (ii)\u00a0at cost
        plus a fixed margin, which will depend on the nature of the equipment purchased.
        under the receiver agreement, our margins will be increased if we are able
        to\\nreduce the costs of our digital set-top boxes and our margins will be
        reduced if these costs increase. \\na\\nmajority of our echostar technologies
        segment''s international revenue during each of the years ended december\u00a031,
        2013, 2012 and 2011 was attributable to sales of digital set-top boxes to\\nbell
        tv. in 2012, we amended our pricing agreement with bell tv, which extended
        our exclusivity rights until december\u00a031, 2013. among other things, the
        pricing agreement, as amended, entitles\\nus to be bell tv''s exclusive provider
        of digital set-top boxes, subject to certain limited exceptions, and provides
        fixed pricing over the term of the agreement as well as providing future engineering\\ndevelopment
        for enhanced bell tv service offerings. in january 2014, we amended the pricing
        agreement, which extended our exclusivity rights under the pricing agreement
        until february\u00a028, 2014. \\n our competition  \\nthe set-top box industry
        is highly competitive, and market leadership changes frequently as a result
        of new products, designs and pricing. as we seek\\nto grow our revenue and
        market share in the digital set-top box industry, we face substantial competition.
        many of our primary competitors, such as arris group,\u00a0inc. (\"arris\"),
        cisco\\nsystems,\u00a0inc. (\"cisco\"), pace micro technology\u00a0plc. (\"pace\"),
        samsung, and technicolor\u00a0s.a. (\"technicolor\"), have established longstanding
        relationships with their customers. in\\naddition, a number of rapidly growing
        companies have recently entered the market with set-top box \\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\nofferings\\nsimilar to our existing satellite set-top
        box products. the entry of these new competitors may result in increased pricing
        pressure in the market. we may also face competition from\\ninternational
        developers of digital set-top box systems that may be able to develop and
        manufacture products and services at costs that are substantially lower than
        ours. furthermore, we depend\\nheavily on our ability to successfully bring
        advanced technologies, including internet delivery of video content and our
        slingbox placeshifting technology, to market to keep pace with our competitors.
        \\nour\\nuse of proprietary technology, together with our in-house engineering
        expertise, enables us to innovate and bring new features and enhancements
        quickly to our primary customers. in addition, our\\nend-to-end video solution
        allows us to provide a more cost-effective solution for a pay-tv operator
        who may have to negotiate hardware, middleware and a conditional access system
        separately. we have a\\nlong-standing relationship with dish network and provide
        to them technologically advanced set-top\\nboxes, including advanced hybrid
        satellite and internet protocol over-the-top delivery solutions, slingbox
        placeshifting technology, and whole-home dvr functionality. \\n our manufacturers  \\nalthough
        we design, engineer and distribute digital set-top boxes and related products,
        we are not directly engaged in the manufacturing process.\\nrather, we outsource
        the manufacturing of our digital set-top boxes and related products to third
        parties who manufacture our products according to specifications supplied
        by us. we depend on a few\\nmanufacturers, and in some cases a single manufacturer,
        for the production of digital set-top boxes and related products. although
        there can be no assurance, we do not believe that the loss of any\\nsingle
        manufacturer would materially impact our business. sanmina-sci corporation,
        shanghai dd&tt electronic enterprise\u00a0co.,\u00a0ltd and jabil circuit,\u00a0inc.

        \\n hughes segment  \\n our products and services  \\nour hughes segment uses
        its two owned satellites, spaceway\u00a03 and echostar\u00a0xvii, and additional
        satellite capacity acquired from\\nmultiple third-party providers, to provide
        satellite broadband internet access to north american consumers, which we
        refer to as the consumer market, and broadband network services and equipment
        to\\ndomestic and international enterprise markets. our hughes segment also
        provides managed services to large enterprises and solutions to customers
        for mobile satellite systems. we incorporate advances\\nin technology to reduce
        costs and to increase the functionality and reliability of our products and
        services. through the usage of advanced spectrally efficient modulation and
        coding methodologies,\\nproprietary software web acceleration and compression
        techniques, we continue to improve the efficiency of our networks. we invest
        in technologies to enhance our system and network management\\ncapabilities,
        specifically our managed services for enterprises. we also continue to invest
        in next generation technologies that can be applied to our future products
        and services. beginning in\\noctober 2012, we introduced hughesnet gen4 broadband
        internet services to our customers in north america on echostar\u00a0xvii,
        which was launched in july 2012. in october 2012, we entered into a\\ndistribution
        agreement (the \"distribution agreement\") with dishnet satellite broadband
        l.l.c. (\"dishnet\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of dish network, pursuant
        to which dishnet has the right, but not\\nthe obligation, to market, sell
        and distribute the hughes satellite internet service (the \"hughes service\")
        under the dishnet brand. see\\nnote\u00a019 in the notes to consolidated financial
        statements in item\u00a015 of this report for further discussion of our related

        december\u00a031, 2013 and 2012, our hughes segment had approximately 860,000
        and 636,000 broadband subscribers, respectively, of which 635,000 and 588,000
        were residential retail subscribers,\\nrespectively. these broadband subscribers
        include customers that subscribe to our hughesnet broadband services, through
        retail, wholesale and small/medium enterprise service channels. \\nas\\nof
        december\u00a031, 2013 and 2012, our hughes segment had approximately $1.15\u00a0billion
        and $1.06\u00a0billion, respectively, of contracted revenue backlog. we define
        hughes revenue\\nbacklog as our expected future revenue under customer contracts
        that are non-cancelable, excluding agreements with customers in our consumer
        market. of the total contracted revenue backlog as of\\ndecember\u00a031,
        2013, we expect to recognize approximately $383.1\u00a0million of revenue
        in 2014. \\n our competition  \\nthe network communications industry is highly
        competitive. as a global provider of data network products and services, our
        hughes segment competes\\nwith a large number of telecommunications service
        providers. this increasingly competitive environment has put pressure on prices
        and margins. to compete effectively, we emphasize, among other things,\\nour
        network quality, our\\ncustomization capability, our offering of networks
        as a turnkey managed service, our position as a single point of contact for
        products and services and our competitive prices. \\nin\\nour consumer market,
        we compete against traditional telecommunications and wireless carriers, as
        well as digital subscriber line (\"dsl\") and cable internet service providers
        offering\\ncompetitive services in many communities we seek to serve. cost,
        speed and accessibility are key determining factors in the election of a service
        provider by the consumer. our primary satellite\\ncompetitor in our north
        american consumer market is viasat communications,\u00a0inc. (\"viasat communications\"),
        which is owned by viasat,\u00a0inc. (\"viasat\"). in addition, we face competition\\nagainst
        established domestic carriers such as at&t corp., verizon communications\u00a0inc.,
        and sprint corporation and multiple cable operators. we seek to differentiate
        ourselves based on the\\nubiquitous availability of our service, quality,
        proprietary technology, and distribution channels. \\nin\\nour enterprise
        market, our principal competitors for the supply of very-small-aperture terminal
        (\"vsat\") satellite networks are gilat, viasat, sagenet\u00a0llc, newtec
        and idirect technologies\\n(\"idirect\"). to differentiate ourselves from
        our competitors, among other things, we emphasize particular technological
        features of our products and services, our ability to customize networks and\\nperform
        desired development work and the quality of our customer service. we also
        face competition from resellers and numerous local companies who purchase
        equipment and sell services to local\\ncustomers, including domestic and international
        telecom operators, cable companies and other major carriers. \\nour\\nbroadband
        networks generally have an advantage over terrestrial networks where the network
        must reach many locations over large distances, where the customer has a \"last
        mile\" or a congestion\\nproblem that cannot be solved easily with terrestrial
        facilities and where there is a need for transmission to remote locations
        or emerging markets. by comparison, ground-based facilities\\n(e.g.,\u00a0fiber
        optic cables) often have an advantage for carrying large amounts of bulk traffic
        between a small number of fixed locations. \\nwith\\nspaceway\u00a03, echostar\u00a0xvii
        and additional satellite capacity acquired from multiple third-party providers,
        we believe that we will have sufficient capacity to grow our consumer\\nbroadband
        business in 2014. however, faster subscriber growth rates than anticipated
        or increases in subscriber consumption of capacity beyond our current expectations
        could force us to modify our\\nmarketing and business plans in some of our
        coverage regions. our relative competitive position is constantly changing
        as we and our competitors strive to improve our respective positions. while
        our\\ncurrent competitive position provides \\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\nus\\nthe
        opportunity to grow our business, we cannot be certain of its continuing effects
        on our business as our competitors modify or adapt their strategies and service
        offerings. \\n manufacturing  \\ncertain products in our hughes segment are
        assembled at our facilities in maryland and we outsource a significant portion
        of the manufacturing of our\\nproducts to third parties. we believe that the
        manufacturing facilities used by our hughes segment have sufficient capacity
        to handle current demand. we adjust our capacity based on our production\\nrequirements.
        we also work with third-party vendors for the development and manufacture
        of components that are integrated into our products. we develop dual sourcing
        capabilities for critical parts\\nwhen practical and we evaluate outsourced
        subcontract vendors on a periodic basis. our operations group, together with
        our engineering group, works with our vendors and subcontractors to reduce\\ndevelopment
        costs, to increase production efficiency, and to obtain components at lower
        prices. \\n echostar satellite services segment  \\n our services  \\nour
        echostar satellite services segment operates its business using ten of its
        owned and leased in-orbit satellites, including the\\nechostar\u00a0xvi satellite
        launched in november 2012. we lease capacity on a full-time and occasional-use
        basis primarily to dish network, and secondarily to dish mexico, u.s. government
        service\\nproviders, state agencies, internet service providers, broadcast
        news organizations, programmers and private enterprise customers. in january
        2013, we began to lease echostar\u00a0xvi to dish\\nnetwork for the delivery
        of dth broadcast services to dish network customers in the u.s. our satellite

        of live sporting events, internet access, disaster recovery, and satellite
        news gathering services.   \\n\u0095government\\nservices.\u00a0\u00a0we provide
        satellite services and technical services to u.s. government service providers
        and directly to some state agencies.\\nwe believe the u.s. government may

        response, continuing education, distance learning, and training.  \\n\u0095network\\nservices.\u00a0\u00a0we
        provide satellite capacity and terrestrial network services to companies.
        these networks are dedicated private networks\\nthat allow delivery of video
        and data services for corporate communications. our satellites can be used
        for point-to-point or point to multi-point communications. \\n\\n our customers  \\nwe
        provide satellite capacity on our satellite fleet primarily to dish network,
        but also to a small number of u.s. government service providers,\\nstate agencies,
        internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, programmers and
        private enterprise customers. currently, due to our limited customer base,
        we have unused satellite capacity.\\nfor the years ended december\u00a031,
        2013, 2012 and 2011, dish network accounted for approximately 74.9%, 72.4%
        and 77.6% of our total echostar satellite services segment revenue. we have
        entered\\ninto certain commercial agreements with dish network pursuant to
        which we are obligated to provide dish network with satellite services at
        fixed prices for varying lengths of time depending on the\\nsatellite. see
        note\u00a019 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item\u00a015
        of this report for further discussion. while we expect to continue to provide
        satellite services to\\ndish network, its satellite capacity requirements
        may change for a variety of reasons, including its ability to construct and
        launch its own satellites. any termination or reduction in \\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\nthe\\nservices we provide to dish network may cause
        us to have excess capacity on our satellites and require that we aggressively
        pursue alternative sources of revenue for this business. our other\\nsatellite
        service sales generally are characterized by shorter-term contracts or spot
        market sales. \\nas\\nof december\u00a031, 2013 and 2012, our echostar satellite
        services segment had contracted revenue backlog attributable to satellites
        currently in orbit of approximately $1.14\u00a0billion and\\n$1.44\u00a0billion,
        respectively. of the total contracted revenue backlog as of december\u00a031,
        2013, we expect to recognize approximately $242.5\u00a0million of revenue
        in 2014. \\n our competition  \\nour echostar satellite services segment competes
        against larger, well-established satellite service companies, such as intelsat\u00a0s.a.\\n(\"intelsat\"),
        ses\u00a0s.a. (\"ses\"), telesat canada (\"telesat\"), and eutelsat communications\u00a0s.a.
        (\"eutelsat\"), in an industry that is characterized by long-term contracts
        and high costs for\\ncustomers to change service providers. therefore, it
        will be difficult to displace customers from their current relationships with
        our competitors. intelsat and ses maintain key north american orbital\\nslots
        that may further limit competition and competitive pricing. \\nwhile\\nwe
        believe that there may be opportunities to capture new business as a result
        of market trends such as the increased communications demands of homeland
        security initiatives, there can be no\\nassurance that we will be able to
        effectively compete against our competitors due to their significant resources
        and operating history. \\n other business opportunities  \\nwe are exploring
        opportunities to selectively pursue partnerships, joint ventures and strategic
        development/acquisition opportunities, domestically\\nand internationally.
        we believe that investments in these types of opportunities, may allow us
        to increase our existing market share, expand into new markets, support the
        development of new\\nsatellite-delivered services, such as broadband internet
        connectivity and mobile video services, broaden our portfolio of products
        and intellectual property, and strengthen our relationships with our\\ncustomers.
        with our extensive experience in designing, developing, and distributing digital
        set-top boxes and broadband related products, we can leverage the broader
        adoption of advanced technologies\\nto create opportunities for us. we believe
        that dth and satellite broadband services are particularly well-suited for
        countries without extensive telecommunications and cable infrastructure, and
        we\\nintend to continue to seek new investments and customer relationships
        with international dth service and satellite broadband service providers.
        \\nin\\n2012, we acquired the right to use various frequencies at the 45 degree
        west longitude orbital location (\"brazilian authorization\") from anatel,
        the brazilian communications regulatory agency. the\\nbrazilian authorization
        is intended for use in providing pay-tv services in brazil. in september 2013,

        the design and construction of the echostar xix satellite, which is expected
        to be launched in\\nmid-2016. echostar xix is our next-generation, high throughput
        geostationary satellite that will employ a multi-spot beam, bent pipe ka-band

        of our satellites have experienced anomalies, some of which have had a significant
        adverse impact on their remaining useful lives and/or\\ncommercial operations.
        there can be no assurance that future anomalies will not further impact the
        remaining useful life and commercial operation of any of the satellites in
        our fleet. in addition,\\nthere can be no assurance that we can recover critical
        transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in-orbit satellites
        were to fail. we generally do not carry in-orbit insurance on our\\nsatellites;
        therefore, we generally bear the risk of any uninsured in-orbit failures.
        pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing certain portions of our
        indebtedness, we are required, subject\\nto certain limitations on coverage,
        to maintain launch and in-orbit insurance for spaceway\u00a03, echostar\u00a0xvi,
        and echostar\u00a0xvii. the recent satellite anomalies that have affected\\ncertain
        of our satellites are discussed below. \\n owned satellites  \\n echostar\u00a0iii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echostar\u00a0iii
        was originally designed to operate a maximum of 32 dbs transponders in a mode
        that provides service to the entire\\ncontinental united states (\"conus\").
        as a result of the failure of traveling wave tube amplifiers (\"twtas\") in
        previous years, including the most recent failures in february 2013 and april
        2013, only\\nsix transponders are currently available for use. it is \\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\nlikely\\nthat additional twta failures will occur from
        time to time in the future and such failures could further impact commercial
        operation of the satellite. echostar\u00a0iii was fully depreciated\\nin 2009
        and is currently used as an in-orbit spare. \\n echostar\u00a0vi.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echostar\u00a0vi
        was designed to operate 32 dbs transponders with a minimum 12-year useful
        life. prior to 2012, echostar\u00a0vi\\nexperienced solar array anomalies
        and the loss of twtas that did not reduce its useful life; however, these
        solar array anomalies impacted the commercial operation of the satellite.
        echostar\u00a0vi\\nlost (i)\u00a0two additional twtas in march 2012, increasing
        the total number of twtas lost on the satellite to five out of 48 twtas and
        (ii)\u00a0an additional solar array string during the\\nsecond quarter of
        2012, reducing the total power available for use by the spacecraft. the anomalies
        in 2012 did not impact the current commercial operation or the estimated useful
        life of the\\nsatellite. however, there can be no assurance that these anomalies
        or any future anomalies will not reduce the satellite''s useful life or impact
        its commercial operation. echostar\u00a0vi was fully\\ndepreciated in august
        2012. \\n echostar\u00a0viii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echostar\u00a0viii was
        designed to operate 32 dbs transponders in the conus at approximately 120
        watts per channel, switchable to 16 dbs\\ntransponders operating at approximately
        240 watts per channel. prior to and during 2011, echostar\u00a0viii experienced
        several anomalies. in january 2011, echostar\u00a0viii experienced an\\nanomaly
        which temporarily disrupted electrical power to some components, causing an
        interruption of broadcast service and causing one of the two on-board computers
        used to control the satellite to\\nfail. these anomalies have not impacted
        the commercial\\noperation or estimated useful life of the satellite. however,
        if the remaining on-board computer fails, the commercial operation of the
        satellite would cease and result in a complete loss of the\\nsatellite. \\n
        echostar\u00a0xii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echostar\u00a0xii was designed to
        operate 13 dbs transponders at 270 watts per channel in conus mode, or 22
        spot beams using a combination\\nof 135 and 65 watt twtas or hybrid conus/spot
        beam mode. we currently operate echostar xii in spot beam mode. prior to 2010,
        echostar\u00a0xii experienced anomalies resulting in the loss of\\nelectrical
        power available from its solar arrays. in september 2012, november 2012, and
        january 2013, echostar\u00a0xii experienced additional solar array anomalies,
        which further reduced the\\nelectrical power available to operate echostar\u00a0xii.
        an engineering analysis completed in the second quarter of 2013 indicated
        further loss of available electrical power and resulting capacity\\nloss was
        likely. as a result, we recognized a $34.7\u00a0million impairment loss in
        the second quarter of 2013. additional solar array anomalies are likely and,
        if they occur, they will continue to\\ndegrade the operational capability
        of echostar\u00a0xii and could lead to additional impairment charges in the
        future. \\n leased satellites  \\n amc-16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0amc-16,
        an fss satellite, commenced commercial operation during february 2005. amc-16
        was designed to operate 24 ku-band fss transponders that operate at\\napproximately
        120 watts per channel and a ka-band payload consisting of 12 spot beams. in
        each of february 2012, april 2012, and november 2012, amc-16 experienced a
        solar-power anomaly, which caused\\nadditional partial loss of satellite capacity.
        as a result of prior period depreciation and adjustments associated with satellite
        anomalies, the net carrying amount of amc-16 was reduced to zero as of\\ndecember\u00a031,
        2010. thereafter, subsequent reductions in our capital lease obligation resulting
        from reductions in our recurring lease payments are recognized as gains in
        \"other, net\" on our\\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations and
        comprehensive income (loss). upon determination of related reductions in our
        monthly recurring payments, we reduced our capital lease obligation for\\namc-16
        and recognized corresponding gains of $12.6\u00a0million in 2012 and $6.7\u00a0million
        in 2013. there can be no assurance that the existing anomalies or any future
        anomalies will not reduce\\namc-16''s useful life or further impact its commercial
        operations. \\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\n satellite impairments  \\nwe
        evaluate our satellites for impairment and test for recoverability whenever
        events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount\\nmay
        not be recoverable. certain of the anomalies discussed above, and previously
        disclosed, may be considered to represent a significant adverse change in
        the physical condition of a particular\\nsatellite. however, based on the
        redundancy designed within each satellite, certain of these anomalies are
        not necessarily considered to be significant events that would require a test
        of\\nrecoverability. \\nas\\ndiscussed further in note\u00a08 in the notes
        to consolidated financial statements in item\u00a015, we recognized a $34.7\u00a0million
        impairment loss in the second quarter of 2013 as result\\nof the anomalies
        affecting the commercial operation of echostar\u00a0xii, and we recognized
        a $33.0\u00a0million impairment loss in the fourth quarter of 2011 based on
        our analysis of potential\\nuses for the cmbstar satellite for which construction
        was suspended in 2008. \\n government regulations  \\nwe are subject to comprehensive
        regulation by the fcc for our domestic, as well as some international, satellite
        and telecommunications operations\\nand equipment businesses. we are also
        regulated by other federal agencies, state and local authorities, the international
        telecommunication union (\"itu\"), and certain foreign governments, including\\nthe

        and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the u.s. with respect
        to the export of telecommunications\\nequipment and services. depending upon
        the circumstances, noncompliance with applicable legislation or regulations
        could result in suspension or revocation of our licenses or authorizations,
        the\\ntermination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages,

        developments and legislation is not intended to describe all present and proposed
        government regulation and legislation affecting the satellite and digital
        set-top\\nbox equipment markets. government regulations that are currently
        the subject of judicial or administrative proceedings, legislative hearings
        or administrative proposals could adversely affect us and\\nour industries

        or any potential impact they might have on the industry or on our operations.
        \\n regulations applicable to our communications operations  \\n fcc jurisdiction
        over satellite and terrestrial operations  \\nthe communications act of 1934,
        as amended (the \"communications act\") gives the fcc broad authority to regulate
        our satellite and terrestrial\\noperations. all non-federal entities, including
        commercial entities that use radio frequencies to provide communications services
        to, from or within the u.s. are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc\\nunder
        the communications act. specifically, the communications act gives the fcc
        regulatory jurisdiction over the following areas relating to communications
        satellite\\noperations:\\n\\n\\n\u0095the assignment of satellite radio frequencies
        and orbital locations to specific services and companies, the licensing of\\nsatellites
        and earth stations, the granting of related authorizations, and the evaluation
        of the fitness of a company to be a licensee; \\n\u0095approval for the relocation
        of satellites to different orbital locations, the replacement of an existing
        satellite with a\\nnew satellite, and the authorization of specific earth
        stations to communicate with such newly relocated satellites; \\n\u0095ensuring
        compliance with the terms and conditions of assignments, licenses, authorizations,
        and approvals including\\nrequired timetables for construction and operation
        of satellites; \\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\n\\n\\n\u0095avoiding
        harmful interference with other radio frequency emitters; and \\n\u0095ensuring
        compliance with other applicable provisions of the communications act and
        fcc rules and regulations. \\n\\nto\\nobtain fcc licenses and authorizations
        for satellites and earth stations, satellite operators must satisfy enumerated
        legal, technical, and financial qualification requirements. once issued, these\\nlicenses
        and authorizations may be subject to a number of conditions including, among
        other things, satisfaction of certain technical and ongoing due diligence
        obligations, implementation bonds,\\nconstruction milestones, annual regulatory
        fees, and various reporting requirements. applications for new or modified
        satellites and earth stations are necessary for further development and expansion\\nof
        satellite services and generally must receive advance fcc approval. necessary
        approval of these applications may not be granted, may not be granted in a
        timely manner, or may be granted subject to\\nconditions which may be cumbersome.
        the regulatory requirements are subject to periodic change in accordance with
        the provisions of the administrative procedures act. \\n fcc jurisdiction
        over set-top box operations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our digital set-top boxes
        and similar devices must also comply with fcc technical standards and requirements,\\nincluding
        accessibility requirements. the fcc has specific part\u00a015 regulations
        for television broadcast receivers and television interface devices. we are
        also subject to fcc rules on\\ndisability accessibility. \\n separate security
        plug and play.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0u.s. cable companies are required by
        law to separate the security from the other functionality of their set-top
        boxes. set-top\\nboxes used by dbs providers are not currently subject to
        this separate security requirement. however, the fcc is currently considering
        a possible expansion of the requirement to these set-top boxes.\\nthe development
        of a retail market for cable set-top boxes could provide us with an opportunity
        to expand sales of set-top boxes and related equipment for use in non-dbs
        households. the cable industry\\nand consumer electronics companies have reached
        a \"tru2way\" commercial arrangement to resolve many of the outstanding issues
        related to this requirement. we have licensed tru2way technology for use\\nwith
        cable set-top boxes. we cannot predict whether the fcc will impose rules on
        dbs providers that are based on cable \"plug and play\" rules or the concepts
        from the private tru2way commercial\\narrangement. complying with the separate
        security and other \"plug and play\" requirements would require potentially
        costly modifications to our set-top boxes and operations. we cannot predict
        the\\ntiming or outcome of this fcc proceeding. if the fcc were to extend
        or expand its separate security rules or the tru2way commercial arrangement
        to include dbs providers, sales of our set-top boxes to\\ndbs providers may
        be negatively impacted. \\n foreign administrations'' jurisdiction over satellite
        and terrestrial operations  \\nsome of our satellites and earth stations are
        licensed in foreign jurisdictions. in order to provide service to a foreign
        location from a u.s.\\nsatellite we may be required to obtain approvals from
        foreign administrative agencies. the laws and regulations addressing access
        to satellite and terrestrial systems vary from country to country. in\\ncertain
        countries, a license is required to provide our services and to operate satellite
        earth stations. the application procedure can be time-consuming and costly,
        and the terms of licenses vary\\nfrom country to country. some countries may
        have restrictions on the services we provide and how we provide them. in addition,
        certain countries may limit the fees that can be charged for the services\\nwe
        provide. \\nmany\\ncountries permit competition in the provision of voice,
        data, or video services, the ownership of the equipment needed to provide
        telecommunications services and the provision of transponder\\ncapacity to
        that country. in some countries, however, a single entity, often the government-owned
        telecommunications authority, may hold a monopoly on the ownership and operation
        of telecommunications\\nfacilities or on the provision of telecommunications
        to, from or within the country. in those cases, we may be required to negotiate
        for access to service or equipment provided by that monopoly\\nentity, and
        we may not be able to obtain favorable rates or other terms. \\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents \\n licenses, authorizations and contractual rights for
        satellite capacity  \\nour spacecraft operations are subject to the licensing
        jurisdiction of, and conditions imposed by, among others, the fcc and any
        other government\\nwhose itu filing we use for our satellites. such conditions
        may include, for example, implementation and operation of the satellite system
        in a manner consistent with certain milestones (such as for\\ncontracting,
        satellite design, construction, launch, and implementation of service), that
        the satellite or its launch be procured through a national entity, that the
        satellite control center be\\nlocated in national territory, that a license
        be obtained prior to launching or operating the satellite, or that a license
        be obtained before interconnecting with the local switched telephone network.
        \\n duration of satellite and terrestrial licenses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0generally
        speaking, all satellite licenses granted by the fcc and most foreign countries
        are subject to expiration\\nunless extended by the relevant regulatory authority.
        the term of each of our u.s. dbs licenses is 10\u00a0years, and our u.s. fss
        licenses generally have 15-year terms. our licenses are currently\\nset to
        expire at various times. in addition, we\\noccasionally receive special temporary
        authorizations that are granted for limited periods of time (e.g.,\u00a0180\u00a0days
        or less) and subject to possible extension. generally, our satellite\\nlicenses
        and special temporary authorizations have been renewed on a routine basis,
        but there can be no assurance that this will continue. \\nthe\\nearth station
        licenses we hold are granted for terms that vary significantly depending upon
        the jurisdiction in which they were obtained. some regulators have granted
        periodic requests by us for\\nspecial temporary authorizations to operate
        new or modified facilities on a temporary basis, or experimental authorizations
        that allow us to test and develop new equipment or new service capabilities\\non
        a limited basis. there can be no assurance that the fcc or other regulators
        will continue granting applications for new earth stations or for the renewal
        of existing ones. \\n interference from other services sharing satellite spectrum.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the
        fcc and some other regulators have adopted rules that allow non-geostationary
        orbit satellite\\nservices to operate on a co-primary basis in the same frequency
        band as dbs and fss. the fcc has also authorized the use of multichannel video
        and data distribution service (\"mvdds\") in the dbs band.\\nseveral mvdds
        systems are now being commercially deployed. despite regulatory provisions
        designed to protect dbs and fss operations from harmful interference, there
        can be no assurance that operations\\nby other satellites or terrestrial communication
        services in the dbs and fss bands will not interfere with our dbs and fss
        operations and adversely affect our business. \\n international satellite
        competition and interference for our dth video satellites.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we
        have received authority to provide dbs service to the u.s. from a mexican\\norbital
        slot at 77 degrees, and a canadian orbital slot at 72.7 degrees. directv,
        spectrum five\u00a0llc, and dish network have received similar authorizations
        to provide service to the u.s. from\\nforeign orbital slots. the possibility
        that the fcc will allow service to the u.s. from additional foreign slots
        may permit additional competition against us from other satellite providers.
        in\\naddition, a number of administrations, such as the united kingdom and
        the netherlands, have requested to allow satellite systems to have access
        to orbital locations serving the u.s. near our licensed\\nslots. such operations
        could cause harmful interference to our satellites and constrain our future
        operations at those slots if such \"tweener\" operations are approved by the
        fcc. \\n telecommunications regulation  \\nwe are required to contribute a
        percentage of our revenue from telecommunications services to the universal
        service fund to support mechanisms that\\nsubsidize the provision of services
        to low-income consumers, high-cost areas, schools, libraries, and rural health
        care\\nproviders. this percentage is set each calendar quarter by the fcc.
        current fcc rules permit us to pass this universal service fund \\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\ncontribution\\nthrough to our customers. the fcc also
        requires broadband internet access and internet telephony service providers
        to comply with the requirements of the federal communications assistance\\nfor
        law enforcement act (\"calea\"). calea generally requires telecommunications
        carriers, including satellite-based carriers, to ensure that law enforcement
        agencies are able to conduct\\nlawfully-authorized surveillance of users of
        their services. in addition, as a provider of interconnected voice over internet
        protocol services (\"voip\"), we are required to abide by a number of rules\\nrelated
        to telephony service, including rules dealing with the protection of customer
        information and the processing of emergency calls. \\n state and local regulation  \\nwe
        are also regulated by state and local authorities. while the fcc has preempted
        many state and local regulations that would impair the installation\\nand
        use of vsats and other consumer satellite dishes, our businesses nonetheless
        may be subject to state and local regulation, including, among others, obtaining
        regulatory authorizations and zoning\\nregulations that affect the ability
        to install these consumer satellite earth station antennas. \\n international
        regulation  \\nwe are subject to regulation by the international communications
        union (\"itu\") and our satellites must be registered in the united nations
        (\"un\")\\nregistry of space objects. \\n the itu frequency registration.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the
        orbital location and frequencies for certain of our satellites are subject
        to the frequency registration and coordination\\nprocess of the itu. the itu
        radio regulations define the international rules, regulations, and rights
        for a satellite and associated earth stations to use specific radio frequencies
        at a specific\\norbital location. these rules, which include deadlines for
        the bringing of satellite networks into use, differ depending on the type
        of service to be provided and the\\nfrequencies to be used by the satellite.
        on our behalf, various countries have made and may in the future make additional
        filings for the frequency assignments at particular orbital locations that
        are\\nused or to be used by our current satellite networks and potential future
        satellite networks we may build or acquire. in the event the international
        coordination process that is triggered by itu\\nfilings under applicable rules
        is not successfully completed, or that the requests for modification of the
        bss plan are not granted by the itu, we will have to operate the applicable
        satellite(s) on a\\nnon-interference basis. if we cannot do so, we may have
        to cease operating such satellite(s) at the affected orbital locations. we
        cannot be sure of the successful outcome of these itu processes. we\\nhave
        cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, with the filing nation in the
        preparation of itu filings, coordination of our operations in accordance with
        the relevant itu radio regulations, and\\nresponses to relevant itu inquiries.
        \\n registration in the un registry of space objects.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the
        u.s. and other jurisdictions in which we license satellites are parties to
        the un convention on the\\nregistration of objects launched into outer space
        (\"un convention\"). \\nthe\\nun convention requires a satellite''s launching
        state to register the satellite as a space object. the act of registration
        carries liability for the registering country in the event that the\\nsatellite
        causes third party damage. administrations may place certain requirements
        on satellite licensees in order to procure the necessary launch or operational
        authorizations that accompany\\nregistration of the satellite. in some jurisdictions,
        these authorizations are separate and distinct, with unique requirements,
        from the authorization to use a set of frequencies to provide satellite\\nservices.
        there is no guarantee that we will be able to procure such authorizations
        even if we already possess a frequency authorization. \\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable
        of contents\\n export control regulation  \\nin the operation of our business,
        we must comply with all applicable export control and economic sanctions laws
        and regulations of the u.s. and other\\ncountries. applicable u.s. laws and
        regulations include the arms export control act, the international traffic
        in arms regulations (\"itar\"), the export administration regulations (\"ear\"),
        and the\\ntrade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the u.s. department
        of the treasury''s office of foreign assets control (\"ofac\"). \\nthe\\nexport
        of certain hardware, technical data, and services relating to satellites and
        the supply of certain ground control equipment, technical data and services
        to non-u.s. persons or to\\ndestinations outside the u.s. is regulated by
        the u.s. department of state''s directorate of defense trade controls, under
        the itar and is subject to strict export control and prior approval\\nrequirements.
        other items are controlled for export by the u.s. department of commerce''s
        bureau of industry and security (\"bis\") under the ear. for example, bis
        regulates our export of satellite\\ncommunications network equipment to non-u.s.
        persons or to destinations outside of the u.s. in addition, we cannot provide
        certain equipment or services to certain countries subject to u.s. trade\\nsanctions
        unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from ofac. we are also
        subject to the foreign corrupt practices act, which generally prohibits companies
        and their intermediaries from\\nmaking improper payments or giving or promising
        to give anything of value to foreign government officials and other individuals
        for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining a\\ncompetitive
        advantage. \\n environmental regulation  \\nwe are subject to the requirements
        of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and occupational safety
        and health laws and regulations. these\\ninclude laws regulating air emissions,
        water discharge, waste management, hazardous chemicals and product disposal,
        most significantly the resource conservation and recovery act (\"rcra\") and
        the\\nemergency planning and community right-to-know act (\"epcra\"). under
        the rcra, our hughes segment is considered a small quantity generator. \\nas\\nrequired
        by the epcra, we file periodic reports with regulators covering four areas:
        emergency planning, emergency release, hazardous chemical storage, and toxic
        chemical release. we maintain small\\nquantities of hazardous materials on
        our premises and, therefore, have relatively modest reporting requirements
        under the epcra. we are also subject to the requirements of other environmental
        and\\noccupational safety and health laws and regulations. additionally, we
        review tier\u00a0ii reporting requirements of the department of environmental
        quality which requires reporting the storage of\\nhazardous materials in large
        quantities and if they''ve changed from year to year. these are state run
        programs and each state may have slightly different requirements. \\nour\\nenvironmental
        compliance costs to date have not been material, and we currently have no
        reason to believe that such costs will become material in the foreseeable
        future. we do not expect capital\\nor other expenditures for environmental
        compliance to be material in 2014. however, environmental requirements are
        complex, change frequently, and have become more stringent over time. accordingly,
        we\\ncannot provide assurance that these requirements will not change or become
        more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse
        effect on our business. \\n patents and trademarks  \\nwe currently rely on
        a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law, together
        with licenses, non-disclosure and confidentiality\\nagreements and technical
        measures, to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products. we
        hold u.s. patents covering various aspects of our products and services, including
        patents covering\\ntechnologies that we believe will enable the production
        of lower cost satellite terminals and provide for significant acceleration
        of communication speeds and enhancement of throughput. the duration\\nof each
        of our u.s. patents is generally 20\u00a0years from the \\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\nearliest\\nfiling date to which the patent has priority.
        we have granted licenses to use our trademarks and service-marks to resellers
        worldwide, and we typically retain the right to monitor the use of\\nthose
        marks and impose significant restrictions on their use in efforts to ensure
        a consistent brand identity. we protect our proprietary rights in our software
        through software licenses that, among\\nother things, require that the software
        source code be maintained as confidential information and that prohibit any
        reverse-engineering of that code. \\nwe\\nbelieve that our patents are important
        to our business. we also believe that, in some areas, the improvement of existing
        products and the development of new products, as well as reliance upon trade\\nsecrets
        and unpatented proprietary know-how, are important in establishing and maintaining
        a competitive advantage. we believe, to a certain extent, that the value of
        our products and services are\\ndependent upon our proprietary software, hardware,
        and other technology remaining trade secrets and/or subject to copyright protection.
        generally, we enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment\\nagreements
        with our employees, subcontractors, and certain customers and other business
        partners. \\nin\\ngeneral, if a court determines that one or more of our products
        infringes valid intellectual property rights held by others, we may be required
        to cease developing or marketing those products,\\nobtain licenses from the
        holders of the intellectual property at a material cost, or redesign those
        products in such a way as to avoid infringement. if those intellectual property
        rights are held by a\\ncompetitor, we may be unable to obtain a license to
        such intellectual property at any price, which could adversely affect our
        competitive position. \\nwe\\nmay not be aware of all patents and other intellectual
        property rights that our products and services may potentially infringe. in
        addition, patent applications in the u.s. are confidential until\\nthe patent
        and trademark office either publishes the application or issues a patent (whichever
        arises first)\\nand, accordingly, our products may infringe claims contained
        in pending patent applications of which we are not aware. further, the process
        of determining definitively whether a patent claim is valid\\nand whether
        a particular product infringes a valid patent claim often involves expensive
        and protracted litigation, even if we are ultimately successful on the merits.
        \\nwe\\ncannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future
        to obtain licenses with respect to intellectual property rights held by others
        and the availability and cost of any such\\nlicenses. those costs, and their
        impact on our results of operations, could be material. damages in patent
        infringement cases can be substantial, and in certain circumstances, can be
        trebled. to the\\nextent that we are required to pay unanticipated royalties
        to third parties, these increased costs of doing business could negatively
        affect our liquidity and operating results. we are currently\\ndefending multiple
        patent infringement actions and may assert our own actions against parties
        we suspect of infringing our patents and trademarks. we cannot be certain
        the courts will conclude these\\ncompanies do not own the rights they claim,
        that these rights are not valid, or that our products and services do not
        infringe on these rights. we also cannot be certain that we will be able to
        obtain\\nlicenses from these persons on commercially reasonable terms or,
        if we were unable to obtain such licenses, that we would be able to redesign
        our products and services to avoid infringement. the legal\\ncosts associated
        with defending patent suits and pursuing patent claims against others may
        be borne by us if we are not awarded reimbursement through the legal process.

        risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. if
        any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition\\nor
        results of operation could be materially and adversely affected. \\n general
        risks affecting our business  \\n we currently derive a significant portion
        of our revenue from our primary customer, dish network. the loss of, or a
        significant reduction in, orders from, or a decrease in\\nselling prices of
        digital set-top boxes, transponder leasing, provision of digital broadcast
        services, broadband equipment and services and/or other products or services
        to dish network would\\nsignificantly reduce our revenue and adversely impact
        our results of operations.  \\ndish network accounted for 58.8%, 49.5% and
        59.9% of our total revenue for the years ended december\u00a031, 2013, 2012
        and 2011, respectively. any\\nreduction in sales to dish network or in the
        prices it pays for the products and services it purchases from us could have
        a significant negative impact on our business. in addition, because a\\nsignificant
        portion of our revenue is derived from dish network, our success also depends
        to a significant degree on the continued success of dish network in attracting
        new subscribers, marketing\\nprogramming packages, and other services and
        features to subscribers that will result in the purchase of new digital set-top
        boxes, and in particular, new digital set-top boxes at the high-end of our\\nproduct
        range that incorporate high-definition, multiple tuners, and other advanced
        technology. if dish network''s gross subscriber additions are adversely affected
        by the sustained economic weakness\\nin the u.s., or for any other reason,
        we may experience a decline in our sales of digital set-top boxes to dish
        network. in addition, dish network has no obligations to continue to purchase
        our\\nproducts and only certain obligations to continue to purchase certain
        of our services. therefore, our relationship with dish network could be terminated
        or substantially curtailed with little or no\\nadvance notice. any material
        reduction in our sales to dish network would have a significant adverse effect
        on our business, results of operations, and financial position. \\nas\\npreviously
        disclosed by dish network, in may 2012, fox broadcasting company, twentieth
        century fox film corp. and fox television holdings,\u00a0inc. filed a lawsuit
        against dish network\\ncorporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, dish network,
        l.l.c., in the u.s. district court for the central district of california,
        alleging that certain services provided by dish network, including\\nslingbox
        functionality infringe their copyrights and breach their carriage contracts.
        an adverse decision against dish network could decrease the number of sling
        enabled set-top boxes we sell to dish\\nnetwork which could have an adverse
        impact on the business operations of our echostar technologies segment. \\nin\\naddition,
        the timing of orders for digital set-top boxes from dish network could vary
        significantly depending on equipment promotions offered to its subscribers,
        changes in technology, and its use\\nof remanufactured digital set-top boxes,
        which may cause our revenue to vary significantly quarter over quarter and
        could expose us to the risks of inventory shortages or excess inventory. these\\ninventory
        risks are particularly acute during product end-of-life transitions in which
        a new generation of digital set-top boxes is being deployed and inventory
        of older generation digital set-top\\nboxes is at a higher risk of obsolescence.
        this in turn could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.
        furthermore, because of the maturing and competitive nature of the digital
        set-top\\nbox business, the limited number of potential new customers, and
        the short-term nature of our purchase orders with dish network, we could in
        the future experience downward pricing pressure on our\\ndigital set-top boxes
        sold to dish network, which in turn would adversely affect our gross margins
        and profitability. \\nin\\naddition, dish network is currently our primary
        customer of digital set-top boxes and digital broadcast operation services.
        these products and services are provided pursuant to contracts that\\nexpire\\non
        december\u00a031, 2014 and december\u00a031, 2016, respectively. thereafter,
        if we are unable to extend those contracts on similar terms with dish network,
        or if we are otherwise unable to\\nobtain \\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\nacceptable\\nreplacement
        contracts from third parties following a termination by dish network, there
        could be a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
        and financial position.\\nthere are a relatively small number of potential
        new customers for our digital set-top boxes, satellite services, and digital
        broadcast operations, and we expect this customer concentration to\\ncontinue
        for the foreseeable future. if we lose dish network as a customer, it will
        be difficult for us to replace, in whole or in part, our historical revenue
        from dish network and we have had\\nlimited success in attracting such potential
        new customers in the past. therefore, our operating results will likely continue
        to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers, as well as\\nthe
        continued success of these customers. in addition, we may, from time to time,
        enter into customer agreements providing for exclusivity periods during which
        we may sell a specified product only to\\nthat customer. if we do not develop
        relationships with new customers, we may not be able to expand our customer
        base or maintain or increase our revenue. \\n we could face decreased demand
        and increased pricing pressure to our products and services due to competition.  \\n\\n\\n\u0095the
        digital set-top box market is intensely competitive, and market leadership
        changes frequently as a result of new\\nproducts, designs and pricing. currently,
        there are many significant competitors in the set-top box business including
        several established companies who have sold set-top boxes to major cable\\noperators
        in the u.s. for many years. these competitors include arris, cisco, pace,
        samsung, and technicolor. in addition, a number of rapidly growing companies
        have recently entered the market, many\\nof them with set-top box offerings
        similar to our existing satellite set-top box products. we also expect additional
        competition in the future from new and existing companies that do not currently\\ncompete
        in the market for set-top boxes. the entry of these new competitors may result
        in increased pricing pressure in the market. if market prices are substantially
        reduced, our business, financial\\ncondition or results of operations could
        be materially adversely affected. in particular, it may be difficult for us
        to make profitable sales in international markets where these new competitors
        are\\npresent and in which we have not previously made sales of set-top boxes.
        as the set-top box business evolves, our current and potential competitors
        may establish cooperative relationships among\\nthemselves or with third parties,
        including software and hardware companies that could acquire significant market
        share, which could adversely affect our business. we also face competition
        from\\nset-top boxes that have been internally developed by digital video
        providers. if we do not distinguish our products, particularly our retail
        products, through distinctive, technologically advanced\\nfeatures and design,
        as well as build and strengthen our brand recognition, our business could
        be harmed as we may not be able to effectively compete on price alone against
        new low cost market\\nentrants. any of these competitive threats, alone or
        in combination with others, could harm our business, operating results and
        financial condition. \\n\\n\\n\\nfurthermore,\\nour customers face competition
        from providers of digital media, including companies that offer online services
        distributing movies, television shows and other video programming. as\\ntechnologies
        develop, other means of delivering information and entertainment to television
        viewers are evolving. to the extent that these technologies compete successfully
        against our customers for\\nviewers, the ability of our existing customer
        base to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected. as a result,
        demand for our satellite television digital set-top boxes could decline and\\nwe
        may not be able to sustain our current revenue levels. \\n\\n\\n\u0095our
        satellite services business competes against larger, well-established satellite
        service companies, such as intelsat,\\nses, telesat, and eutelsat. because
        the satellite services industry is relatively mature, our growth strategy
        depends largely on our ability to displace current incumbent providers, which
        often have\\nthe benefit of long-term contracts with customers. these long-term
        contracts and other factors result in relatively high costs for customers
        to change service providers, making it more difficult for\\nus to displace
        customers from their current \\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\n\\n\\nrelationships\\nwith
        our competitors. in addition, the supply of satellite capacity available in
        the market has increased in recent years, which makes it more difficult for
        us to sell our services in\\ncertain markets and to price our capacity at
        acceptable levels. competition may cause downward pressure on prices and further
        reduce the utilization of our fleet capacity, both of which could have an\\nadverse
        effect on our financial performance. our echostar satellite services segment
        also competes with fiber optic cable and other terrestrial delivery systems,
        which may have a cost advantage,\\nparticularly in point-to-point applications
        where such delivery systems have been installed. \\n\\n\\n\u0095in our consumer
        market, we face competition primarily from dsl and cable internet service
        providers. also, other\\ntelecommunications, satellite and wireless broadband
        companies have launched or are planning the launch of consumer satellite internet
        access services in competition with our service offerings in\\nnorth america.
        some of these competitors offer consumer services and hardware at lower prices
        than ours. in addition, terrestrial alternatives do not require our external
        dish, which may limit\\ncustomer acceptance of our products. our primary competitor
        for consumer satellite internet access services is viasat communications,
        which is owned by viasat. there can be no assurance that our\\nproduct offerings
        will remain competitive with those of viasat communications. \\n\u0095in our
        enterprise network communications market, we face competition from providers
        of terrestrial-based networks, such as\\nfiber, dsl, cable modem service,
        multiprotocol label switching and internet protocol-based virtual private
        networks, which may have advantages over satellite networks for certain customer\\napplications.
        the network communications industry is characterized by competitive pressures
        to provide enhanced functionality for the same or lower price with each new
        generation of technology.\\nterrestrial-based networks are offered by telecommunications
        carriers and other large companies, many of which have substantially greater
        financial resources and greater name recognition than us. as\\nthe prices
        of our products decrease, we will need to sell more products and/or reduce
        the per-unit costs to improve or maintain our results of operations. the costs
        of a satellite network may exceed\\nthose of a terrestrial-based network,
        especially in areas that have experienced significant dsl and cable internet
        build-out. it may become more difficult for us to compete with terrestrial
        providers\\nas the number of these areas increases and the cost of their network
        and hardware services declines. terrestrial networks also have a competitive
        edge because of lower latency for data transmission. \\n\\n the average selling
        price and gross margins of our digital set-top boxes have been decreasing
        and may decrease even further, which could negatively impact our financial\\nposition
        and results of operations.  \\nthe average selling price and gross margins
        of our digital set-top boxes have been decreasing and may decrease even further
        due to, among other\\nthings, an increase in the sales of lower-priced digital
        set-top boxes to dish network and increased competitive pricing pressure.
        furthermore, our ability to increase the average selling prices of\\nour digital
        set-top boxes is limited and our average selling price may decrease even further
        in response to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by
        us or our competitors, lack of\\ndemand for our new product introductions
        or other factors. if we are unable to increase or at least maintain the average
        selling prices of our digital set-top boxes, or if such selling prices further\\ndecline,
        and we are unable to respond in a timely manner by developing and introducing
        new products and continually reducing our product costs, our revenue and gross
        margin may be negatively affected,\\nwhich will harm our financial position
        and results of operations. \\n22\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\n if significant
        numbers of television viewers are unwilling to pay for pay-tv services that
        utilize digital set-top boxes, we may not be able to sustain our current revenue\\nlevel.  \\nwe
        are substantially dependent upon the ability of our customers to promote the
        delivery of pay-tv services, including, among others, premium\\nprogramming
        packages and services that utilize technology incorporated into our digital
        set-top boxes, such as hd technology and iptv, to generate future revenue.
        \\nhowever,\\nour customers may be unsuccessful in promoting value-added services
        or may promote alternative packages, such as free programming packages, in
        lieu of promoting packages that utilize our\\nhigh-end digital set-top box
        offerings. if our customers are unable to develop and effectively market compelling
        reasons for their subscribers to continue to purchase their pay-tv services
        that\\nutilize our more advanced digital set-top boxes, it will be difficult
        for us to sustain our historical revenue. this risk is exacerbated by the
        sustained economic weakness under which consumers become\\nmore cost-sensitive
        in their discretionary spending and by increasing consumer demand for online
        platforms that provide for the distribution and viewing of video programming
        that competes with our\\ncustomers'' pay-tv services. \\n we may have unused
        satellite capacity in our echostar satellite services segment, and our results
        of operations may be materially adversely affected if we are not able to\\nlease
        this capacity to third parties, including dish network.  \\nwe currently have
        unused satellite capacity in our echostar satellite services segment. while
        we are currently evaluating various opportunities to\\nmake profitable use
        of our satellite capacity (including, but not limited to, supplying satellite
        capacity for new international ventures), we do not have firm plans to utilize
        all of our satellite\\ncapacity. there can be no assurance that we can successfully
        develop the business opportunities we currently plan to pursue to utilize
        this capacity. if we are unable to lease our satellite capacity\\nto third
        parties, including dish network, our margins could be negatively impacted
        and we may be required to record impairments related to our satellites. \\n
        the failure to adequately anticipate the need for satellite capacity or the
        inability to obtain satellite capacity for our hughes segment could harm our
        results of\\noperations.  \\nour hughes segment has made substantial contractual
        commitments for satellite capacity based on our existing customer contracts
        and backlog, as well\\nas anticipated future business, to the extent our existing
        broadband customers are not expected to utilize our spaceway\u00a03 or echostar\u00a0xvii
        satellites. if future demand does not meet our\\nexpectations, we will be
        committed to maintaining excess satellite capacity for which we will have
        insufficient revenue to cover our costs, which would have a negative impact
        on our margins and\\nresults of operations. we have satellite capacity commitments
        for ku-band frequencies, generally for two to five year terms, with third
        parties to cover different geographical areas or support\\ndifferent applications
        and features; therefore, we may not be able to quickly or easily adjust our
        capacity to changes in demand. if we only purchase satellite capacity based
        on existing contracts and\\nbookings, capacity for certain types of coverage
        in the future may not be readily served or available to us, and we may not
        be able to satisfy certain needs of our customers, which could result in a\\nloss
        of possible new business and could negatively impact the margins earned for
        those services. at present, until the launch and operation of additional satellites,
        there is limited availability of\\ncapacity on the ku-band frequencies in
        north america. in addition, the fss industry has seen consolidation in the
        past decade, and today, the main fss providers in north america and a number
        of\\nsmaller regional providers own and operate the current satellites that
        are available for our capacity needs. the failure of any of these fss providers
        to replace existing satellite assets at the end\\nof their useful lives or
        a downturn in their industry as a whole could reduce or interrupt the ku-band
        capacity available to us. if we are not able to renew our capacity leases
        at economically viable\\nrates, or \\n23\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\nif\\ncapacity
        is not available due to any problems of the fss providers, our business and
        results of operations could be adversely affected. \\n we are dependent upon
        third-party providers for components, manufacturing, installation services,
        and customer support services, and our results of operations may be\\nmaterially
        adversely affected if any of these third-party providers fail to appropriately
        deliver the contracted goods or services.  \\nwe are dependent upon third-party
        services and products provided to us, including the following: \\n\\n\\n\u0095components.\u00a0\u00a0a
        limited number of suppliers and in some cases a single supplier\\nmanufacture
        some of the key components required to build our products. our reliance on
        a single or limited group of suppliers, particularly foreign suppliers, and
        our increasing reliance on\\nsubcontractors, involves several risks. these
        risks include a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required
        components, and reduced control over pricing, quality, and timely delivery
        of\\nthese components. we do not generally maintain long-term agreements with
        any of our suppliers or subcontractors for our products. an inability to obtain
        adequate deliveries or any other circumstances\\nrequiring us to seek alternative
        sources of supply could affect our ability to ship our digital set-top boxes
        on a timely basis, which could damage our relationships with current and prospective\\ncustomers
        and harm our business, resulting in a loss of market share, and reduce revenue
        and income.   \\n\u0095commodity price\\nrisk.\u00a0\u00a0fluctuations in
        pricing of raw materials have the ability to affect our product costs. to
        the extent that component pricing does\\nnot decline or increases, whether
        due to inflation, increased demand, decreased supply or other factors, we
        may not be able to pass on the impact of increasing raw materials prices or
        labor and other\\ncosts, to our customers, and we may not be able to operate
        profitably. although we have been successful in offsetting or mitigating our
        exposure to these fluctuations, such changes could have an\\nadverse impact
        on our product costs.   \\n\u0095manufacturing.\u00a0\u00a0while we develop
        and manufacture prototypes for our products, we use\\ncontract manufacturers
        to produce a significant portion of our hardware. if these contract manufacturers
        fail to provide products that meet our specifications in a timely manner,
        then our customer\\nrelationships may be harmed.   \\n\u0095installation and
        customer support\\nservices.\u00a0\u00a0each of our north american and international
        operations utilizes a network of third-party installers to deploy our hardware.\\nin
        addition, a portion of our customer support and management is provided by
        offshore call centers. since we provide customized services for our customers
        that are essential to their operations, a\\ndecline in levels of service or
        attention to the needs of our customers could adversely affect our reputation,
        renewal rates and ability to win new business. \\n\\n our foreign operations
        expose us to regulatory risks and restrictions not present in our domestic
        operations.  \\nour operations outside the u.s. accounted for approximately
        14.1%, 23.0% and 19.3% of our revenue for the years ended december\u00a031,
        2013, 2012\\nand 2011, respectively. collectively, we expect our foreign operations
        to continue to represent a significant portion of our business. we have operations
        in brazil, germany, india, indonesia, italy,\\nmexico, the russian federation,
        the united arab emirates, ireland and the united kingdom, among other nations.
        over the last 10\u00a0years, we have sold products in over 100 countries.
        our foreign\\noperations involve varying degrees of risk and uncertainties
        inherent in doing business abroad. such risks include: \\n\\n\\n\u0095complications
        in complying with restrictions on foreign ownership and\\ninvestment and limitations
        on repatriation.\u00a0\u00a0we may not be permitted to own our operations
        in some countries and may have to enter into\\npartnership or joint venture
        relationships. many foreign legal regimes restrict our \\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\n\\n\\nrepatriation\\nof earnings to the u.s. from our
        subsidiaries and joint venture entities. applicable law in such foreign countries
        may also limit our ability to distribute or access our assets in certain\\ncircumstances.
        in such event, we will not have access to the cash flow and assets of our
        joint ventures.  \\n\\n\\n\u0095difficulties in following a variety of laws
        and regulations related to\\nforeign operations.\u00a0\u00a0our international
        operations are subject to the laws of many different jurisdictions that may
        differ significantly\\nfrom u.s. law. for example, local political or intellectual
        property law may hold us responsible for the data that is transmitted over
        our network by our customers. in addition, we are subject to the\\nforeign
        corrupt practices act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions
        that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper
        payments or giving or promising to\\ngive anything of value to foreign officials
        and other individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or
        gaining a competitive advantage. our policies mandate compliance with these\\nlaws.
        however, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption
        to some degree. compliance with these laws may lead to increased operations
        costs or loss of business\\nopportunities. violations of these laws could
        result in fines or other penalties or sanctions, which could have a material
        adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of\\noperations.   \\n\u0095restrictions
        on space station landing\\nrights/coordination.\u00a0\u00a0satellite market
        access and landing rights are dependent on the national regulations established
        by foreign\\ngovernments, including, but not limited to: (a)\u00a0national
        coordination requirements and registration requirements for satellites; and
        (b)\u00a0reporting requirements of national\\ntelecommunications regulators
        with respect to service provision and satellite performance. in addition,
        we must comply with foreign national requirements for the registration of
        satellites and\\nassociated obligations. because regulatory schemes vary by
        country, we may be subject to laws or regulations in foreign countries of
        which we are not presently aware. non-compliance with these\\nrequirements
        may result in the loss of the authorizations and licenses to conduct business
        in these countries. if that were to be the case, we could be subject to sanctions
        by a foreign government\\nthat could materially and adversely affect our ability
        to operate in that country. there is no assurance that any current regulatory
        approvals held by us are, or will remain, sufficient in the view of\\nforeign
        regulatory authorities, or that any additional necessary approvals will be
        granted on a timely basis or at all, in all jurisdictions in which we wish
        to operate new satellites, or that\\napplicable restrictions in those jurisdictions
        will not be unduly burdensome. the failure to obtain the authorizations necessary
        to operate satellites internationally could have a material adverse\\neffect
        on our ability to generate revenue and our overall competitive position.   \\n\u0095financial
        and legal constraints and\\nobligations.\u00a0\u00a0operating pursuant to
        foreign licenses subjects us to certain financial constraints and obligations,
        including, but not\\nlimited to: (a)\u00a0tax liabilities that may or may
        not be dependent on revenues; (b)\u00a0the burden of creating and maintaining
        additional facilities and staffing in foreign jurisdictions; and\\n(c)\u00a0legal
        regulations requiring that we make certain satellite capacity available for
        \"free,\" which may impact our revenue. in addition, if we ever need to pursue
        legal remedies against our\\ncustomers or our business partners located outside
        of the u.s., it may be difficult for us to enforce our rights against them.
        \\n\u0095compliance with applicable export control laws and regulations in
        the u.s. and other\\ncountries. we must comply with all applicable export
        control laws and regulations of the u.s. and other countries. u.s. laws and
        regulations applicable to us include the arms\\nexport control act, the itar,
        the ear and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the ofac.
        the export of certain hardware, technical data and services relating to satellites
        is\\nregulated by the u.s. department of state''s directorate of defense trade
        controls under itar. other items are controlled for export by the bis under
        ear. we cannot provide services to certain\\ncountries subject to u.s. trade
        sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from ofac. \\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\n\\n\\nviolations\\nof these laws or regulations could
        result in significant sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements,
        debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed\\nto conduct
        aspects of our international business. a violation of itar or the other regulations
        enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial
        condition and results of\\noperations.  \\n\\n\\n\u0095changes in exchange
        rates between foreign currencies and the u.s.\\ndollar.\u00a0\u00a0we conduct
        our business and incur cost in the local currency of a number of the countries
        in which we operate. accordingly, our\\nresults of operations are reported
        in the relevant local currency and then translated to u.s. dollars at the
        applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements.
        these\\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates have affected, and may in
        the future affect, revenue, profits and cash earned on international sales.
        in addition, we sell our products and services and acquire\\nsupplies and
        components from countries that historically have been, and may continue to
        be, susceptible to recessions or currency devaluation.   \\n\u0095greater
        exposure to the possibility of economic instability, the\\ndisruption of operations
        from labor and political disturbances, expropriation or war.\u00a0\u00a0as
        we conduct operations throughout the world, we\\ncould be subject to regional
        or national economic downturns or instability, labor or political disturbances
        or conflicts of various sizes. any of these disruptions could detrimentally
        affect our sales\\nin the affected region or country or lead to damage to,
        or expropriation of, our property or danger to our personnel.   \\n\u0095competition
        with large or state-owned enterprises and/or regulations\\nthat effectively
        limit our operations and favor local competitors.\u00a0\u00a0many of the countries
        in which we conduct business have traditionally\\nhad state owned or state
        granted monopolies on telecommunications services that favor an incumbent
        service provider. we face competition from these favored and entrenched companies
        in countries that\\nhave not deregulated. the slower pace of deregulation
        in these countries, particularly in asia and latin america, has adversely
        affected the growth of our business in these regions.  \\n\u0095customer credit\\nrisks.\u00a0\u00a0customer
        credit risks are exacerbated in foreign operations because there is often
        little information available about the credit\\nhistories of customers in
        the foreign countries in which we operate. \\n\\n we may experience significant
        financial losses on our existing investments.  \\nwe have entered into certain
        strategic transactions and investments in north and south america, asia and
        elsewhere. these investments involve a high\\ndegree of risk and could diminish
        our ability to fund a share repurchase program, invest capital in our business
        or return capital to our shareholders. the overall sustained economic uncertainty,
        as\\nwell as financial, operational and other difficulties encountered by
        certain companies in which we have invested increases the risk that the actual
        amounts realized in the future on our debt and\\nequity investments will differ
        significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. these investments
        could also expose us to significant financial losses and may restrict our
        ability to\\nmake other investments or limit alternative uses of our capital
        resources. if our investments suffer losses, our financial condition could
        be materially adversely affected. in addition, the companies\\nin which we
        invest or with whom we partner may not be able to compete effectively or there
        may be insufficient demand for the services and products offered by these
        companies. \\n we may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions
        to complement or expand our business, which may not be successful and we may
        lose a portion or all of our\\ninvestment in these acquisitions and transactions.  \\nour
        future success may depend on the existence of, and our ability to capitalize
        on, opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies or\\npartner
        with other companies that could complement, \\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of
        contents\\nenhance\\nor expand our current business or products or that may
        otherwise offer us growth opportunities. we may pursue acquisitions, joint
        ventures or other business combination activities to\\ncomplement or expand
        our business. any such acquisitions, transactions or investments that we are
        able to identify and complete which may become substantial over time, involve
        a high degree of risk,\\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\\n\\n\\n\u0095the
        diversion of our management''s attention from our existing business to integrate
        the operations and personnel of the\\nacquired or combined business or joint
        venture; \\n\u0095possible adverse effects on our operating results during
        the integration process;  \\n\u0095exposure to significant financial losses
        if the transactions and/or the underlying ventures are not successful; and/or
        we\\nare unable to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction; \\n\u0095the
        inability to obtain in the anticipated time frame, or at all, any regulatory
        approvals required to complete proposed\\nacquisitions, transactions or investments;
        and \\n\u0095the risks associated with complying with regulations applicable
        to the acquired business which may cause us to incur\\nsubstantial expenses.
        \\n\\nnew\\nacquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions may require
        the commitment of significant capital that may otherwise be directed to investments
        in our existing businesses or be distributed to\\nshareholders. commitment
        of this capital may cause us to defer or suspend any share repurchases or
        capital expenditures that we otherwise may have made. \\nwe\\nhave made and
        will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and
        marketing for new products, services and related technologies, as well as
        entry into new business areas.\\ninvestments in new technologies and business
        areas are inherently speculative and commercial success thereof depends on
        numerous factors including innovativeness, quality of service and support,
        and\\neffectiveness of sales and marketing. we may not achieve revenue or
        profitability from such investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover,
        even if such products, services, technologies and\\nbusiness area become profitable,
        their operating margins may be minimal. \\n we may not be able to generate
        cash to meet our debt service needs or fund our operations.  \\nhughes satellite
        systems corporation (\"hss\"), our wholly owned subsidiary that, together
        with its subsidiaries, operates our hughes segment and our\\nechostar satellite
        services segment, has incurred significant indebtedness. hss currently has
        outstanding $1.10\u00a0billion of senior secured notes (the \"secured notes\")
        and $900.0\u00a0million\\nof senior unsecured notes (the \"unsecured notes\"
        and, together with the secured notes, the \"notes\"). hss'' ability to make
        payments on or to refinance its indebtedness and to fund its operations will\\ndepend
        on its ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject in part to
        general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other
        factors that are beyond our control. hss\\nmay need to raise additional debt
        in order to fund ongoing operations or to capitalize on business opportunities.
        hss may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future\\nborrowings
        may not be available in amounts sufficient to enable hss to service its indebtedness
        or to fund its operations or other liquidity needs. if hss is unable to generate
        sufficient cash, it may\\nbe forced to take actions such as revising or delaying
        its strategic plans, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets,
        restructuring or refinancing its debt or seeking additional\\nequity capital.
        hss may not be able to affect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms,
        or at all. the indentures governing the notes also limit hss'' ability to
        dispose of assets and use the\\nproceeds from such dispositions. therefore,
        hss may not be able to consummate those dispositions on satisfactory terms,
        or at all, or to use those proceeds in a manner it may otherwise prefer. \\nin\\naddition,
        weakness in the financial markets could make it difficult for us to access
        capital markets at acceptable terms or at all. instability in the equity markets
        could make it difficult for us\\nto raise equity financing without incurring
        substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. in addition, sustained
        \\n27\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\neconomic\\nweakness may limit our
        ability to generate sufficient internal cash to fund investments, capital
        expenditures, acquisitions, and other strategic transactions. we cannot predict
        with any\\ncertainty whether or not we will be impacted by sustained economic
        weakness. as a result, these conditions make it difficult for us to accurately
        forecast and plan future business activities because\\nwe may not have access
        to funding sources necessary for us to pursue organic and strategic business
        development opportunities. \\n covenants in hss'' indentures restrict its
        business in many ways.  \\nthe indentures governing the notes contain various
        covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that limit hss'' ability and/or
        its restricted\\nsubsidiaries'' ability to, among other things:\\n\\n\\n\u0095pay
        dividends or make distributions on hss'' capital stock or repurchase hss''
        capital stock;  \\n\u0095incur additional debt; \\n\u0095make certain investments;
        \\n\u0095create liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions; \\n\u0095merge
        or consolidate with another company; \\n\u0095transfer and sell assets; \\n\u0095enter
        into transactions with affiliates; and \\n\u0095allow to exist certain restrictions
        on the ability of certain subsidiaries of hss to pay dividends, make distributions,\\nmake
        other payments, or transfer assets to hss or its subsidiaries. \\n\\nfailure\\nto
        comply with these and certain other financial covenants, if not cured or waived,
        may result in an event of default under the indentures, which could have a
        material adverse effect on hss''\\nbusiness or prospects. if an event of default
        occurs and is continuing under the respective indenture, the trustee under
        that indenture or the requisite holders of the notes under that indenture
        may\\ndeclare all such notes to be immediately due and payable and, in the
        case of the indenture governing the secured notes, could proceed against the
        collateral that secures the secured notes. hss and\\ncertain of its subsidiaries
        have pledged a significant portion of their assets as collateral under the
        indenture governing the secured notes. if hss does not have enough cash to
        service its debt or\\nfund other liquidity needs, it may be required to take
        actions such as requesting a waiver from the holders of the notes, reducing
        or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or\\nrefinancing
        all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. we
        cannot assure you that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially
        reasonable terms or at all. \\n we rely on key personnel and the loss of their

        or of certain other key executives or the ability of mr.\u00a0ergen or certain
        other key executives to devote sufficient time and effort to\\nour business
        could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
        and results of operations. although all of our executives have agreements
        limiting their ability to work for or\\nconsult with competitors if they leave
        us, we generally do not have employment agreements with them. to the extent
        mr.\u00a0ergen or other officers are performing services to both dish network

        of contents \\n risks related to our satellites  \\n our owned and leased
        satellites in orbit are subject to significant operational and environmental
        risks that could limit our ability to utilize these satellites.  \\nsatellites
        are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. these risks include
        malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, which\\nhave occurred and
        may occur in the future in our satellites and the satellites of other operators
        as a result of various factors, such as satellite design and manufacturing
        defects, problems with the\\npower systems or control systems of the satellites
        and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh environment
        of space. \\nalthough\\nwe work closely with the satellite manufacturers to
        determine and eliminate the cause of anomalies in new satellites and provide
        for redundancies of many critical components in the\\nsatellites, we may not
        be able to prevent anomalies from occurring and may experience anomalies in
        the future, whether of the types described above or arising from the failure
        of other systems or\\ncomponents. \\nany\\nsingle anomaly or series of anomalies
        could materially and adversely affect our ability to utilize the satellite,
        our operations and revenue as well as our relationship with current customers
        and\\nour ability to attract new customers. in particular, future anomalies
        may result in the loss of individual transponders on a satellite, a group
        of transponders on that satellite or the entire\\nsatellite, depending on
        the nature of the anomaly. anomalies may also reduce the expected capacity
        or useful life of a satellite, thereby reducing the revenue that could be
        generated by that\\nsatellite, or create additional expenses due to the need
        to provide replacement or back-up satellites or satellite capacity. \\nmeteoroid\\nevents
        pose a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites. the probability that meteoroids
        will damage those satellites increases significantly when the earth passes
        through the particulate\\nstream left behind by comets. occasionally, increased
        solar activity also poses a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites. \\nsome\\ndecommissioned
        spacecraft are in uncontrolled orbits, which pass through the geostationary
        belt at various points and present hazards to operational spacecraft, including
        our satellites. we may\\nbe required to perform maneuvers to avoid collisions
        and these maneuvers may prove unsuccessful or could reduce the useful life
        of the satellite through the expenditure of fuel to perform these\\nmaneuvers.
        the loss, damage or destruction of any of our satellites as a result of an
        electrostatic storm, collision with space debris, malfunction or other event
        could have a material adverse effect\\non our business, financial condition
        and results of operations. \\n our satellites have minimum design lives ranging
        from 12 to 15\u00a0years, but could fail or suffer reduced capacity before
        then.  \\ngenerally, the minimum design life of each of our satellites ranges
        from 12 to 15\u00a0years. we can provide no assurance, however, as to the\\nactual
        operational lives of our satellites, which may be shorter than their design
        lives. our ability to earn revenue depends on the continued operation of our
        satellites, each of which has a limited\\nuseful life. a number of factors
        affect the useful lives of the satellites, including, among other things,
        the quality of their design and construction, the durability of their component
        parts, the\\nability to continue to maintain proper orbit and control over
        the satellite''s functions, the efficiency of the launch vehicle used, and
        the remaining on-board fuel following orbit insertion. \\nin\\nthe event of
        a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may relocate another satellite
        and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, which could
        have a material adverse effect\\non our business, financial condition and
        results of operations. such a relocation would require fcc approval\\nand,
        among other things, a showing to the fcc that the replacement satellite would
        not cause additional interference compared to the failed or lost satellite.
        we cannot be certain that we could obtain\\nsuch fcc approval. in addition,
        we cannot guarantee that another satellite will be available for \\n29\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\nuse\\nas a replacement for a failed or lost satellite,
        or that such relocation can be accomplished without a substantial utilization
        of fuel. any such utilization of fuel would reduce the operational\\nlife
        of the replacement satellite. \\n our satellites under construction are subject
        to risks related to construction and launch that could limit our ability to
        utilize these satellites.  \\nsatellite construction and launch are subject
        to significant risks, including delays, launch failure and incorrect orbital
        placement. certain launch\\nvehicles that may be used by us have either unproven
        track records or have experienced launch failures in the past. the risks of
        launch delay and failure are usually greater when the launch vehicle\\ndoes
        not have a track record of previous successful flights. launch failures result
        in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need
        both to construct replacement satellites,\\nwhich can take more than three
        years, and to obtain other launch opportunities. construction and launch delays
        could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. historically,
        we\\ngenerally have not carried launch insurance on our satellites; if a launch
        failure were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability
        to fund future satellite procurement and launch\\nopportunities. in addition,
        the occurrence of launch failures, whether on our satellites or those of others
        may significantly reduce the availability of launch insurance on our satellites
        or make\\nlaunch insurance premiums uneconomical. \\n we generally do not
        have commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we use and could face
        significant impairment charges if one of our uninsured satellites fails.  \\nwe
        generally do not carry in-orbit insurance on any of our satellites, other
        than spaceway\u00a03, echostar\u00a0xvi and echostar\u00a0xvii,\\nand often
        do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact
        of launch or in-orbit failures because we believe that the cost of insurance
        premiums is uneconomical relative to\\nthe risk of such failures. if one or
        more of our in-orbit uninsured satellites fail, we could be required to record
        significant impairment charges. \\n our use of certain satellites is often
        dependent on satellite coordination agreements, which may be difficult to
        obtain.  \\nsatellite transmissions and the use of frequencies often are dependent
        on coordination with other satellite systems operated by u.s. or foreign\\nsatellite
        operators, and it can be difficult to determine the outcome of these coordination
        agreements with these other entities and governments. the impact of a coordination
        agreement may result in\\nthe loss of rights to the use of certain frequencies
        or access to certain markets. the significance of such a loss would vary and
        it can therefore be difficult to determine which portion of our\\nrevenue
        will be impacted. \\nfurthermore,\\nthe satellite coordination process is
        conducted under the guidance of the itu radio regulations and the national
        regulations of the satellites involved in the coordination process. these\\nrules
        and regulations could be amended and could therefore materially adversely
        affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n our
        dependence on outside contractors could result in delays related to the design,
        manufacture and launch of our new satellites, which could in turn adversely
        affect our\\noperating results.  \\nthere are a limited number of manufacturers
        that are able to design and build satellites according to the technical specifications
        and standards of\\nquality we require, including airbus defense and space,
        boeing satellite systems, lockheed martin, space systems loral (\"ss/l\")
        and thales alenia space. there are also a limited number\\nof launch service
        providers that are able to launch such satellites, including international
        launch services, arianespace, united launch alliance, add space exploration
        and sea launch company. the\\nloss of any of our manufacturers or launch service
        \\n30\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\nproviders\\ncould increase the cost
        and result in the delay of the design, construction or launch of our satellites.
        even if alternate suppliers for such services are available, we may have difficulty\\nidentifying
        them in a timely manner or we may incur significant additional expense in
        changing suppliers, and this could result in difficulties or delays in the
        design, construction or launch of our\\nsatellites. any delays in the design,
        construction or launch of our satellites could have a material adverse effect
        on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \\n risks
        related to our products and technology  \\n if we are unable to properly respond
        to technological changes, our business could be significantly harmed.  \\nour
        business and the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological
        changes, evolving industry standards and frequent product\\nand service introductions
        and enhancements. if we or our suppliers are unable to properly respond to
        or keep pace with technological developments, fail to develop new technologies,
        or if our\\ncompetitors obtain or develop proprietary technologies that are
        perceived by the market as being superior to ours, our existing products and
        services may become obsolete and demand for our products\\nand services may
        decline. even if we keep up with technological innovation, we may not meet
        the demands of the markets we serve. furthermore, after we have incurred substantial
        research and\\ndevelopment costs, one or more of the technologies under our
        development, or under development by one or more of our strategic partners,
        could become obsolete prior to its introduction. if we are\\nunable to respond
        to or keep pace with technological advances on a cost-effective and timely
        basis, or if our products, applications or services are not accepted by the
        market, then our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations
        would be adversely affected. \\nour\\nresponse to technological developments
        depends, to a significant degree, on the work of technically skilled employees.
        competition for the services of such employees is intense. although we strive\\nto
        attract and retain these employees, we may not succeed in this respect. \\n
        our future growth depends on growing demand for advanced technologies.  \\nfuture
        demand for our digital set-top boxes will depend significantly on the growing
        demand for advanced technologies, such as hdtv, 3d tv, a\\nwhole-home hd dvr
        and broadband internet connectivity. the effective delivery of advanced technologies,
        such as hdtv and 3d tv, will depend on digital television operators developing
        and building\\ninfrastructure to provide widespread hdtv and 3d tv programming.
        if the deployment of, or demand for, advanced technologies, such as hdtv,
        3d tv, a whole-home hd dvr and broadband internet\\nconnectivity, is not as
        widespread or as rapid as we or our customers expect, our revenue growth will
        be limited. \\n our business depends on certain intellectual property rights
        and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. the loss
        of our intellectual property rights\\nor our infringement of the intellectual
        property rights of others could have a significant adverse impact on our business.  \\nwe
        rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as
        licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties, to use\\nour
        technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. legal
        challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims by third parties
        of intellectual property infringement\\ncould require that we enter into royalty
        or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability
        or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the\\nintellectual
        property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently
        conducted, which could require us to change our business practices or limit
        our ability to compete effectively\\nor could otherwise have an adverse effect
        on our results of operations. even if we believe any such challenges or claims
        are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may\\ndivert
        management''s attention and resources away from our business. \\n31\\n\\n\\n\\n
        \\ntable of contents\\nmoreover,\\ndue to the rapid pace of technological
        change, we rely in part on technologies developed or licensed by third parties,
        and if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses or other\\nrequired
        intellectual property rights from these third parties on reasonable terms,
        our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely
        affected. technology licensed from\\nthird parties may have undetected errors
        that impair the functionality or prevent the successful integration of our
        products or services. as a result of any such changes or loss, we may need
        to incur\\nadditional development costs to ensure continued performance of
        our products or suffer delays until replacement technology, if available,
        can be obtained and integrated. \\nin\\naddition, we work with third parties
        such as vendors, contractors and suppliers for the development and manufacture
        of components that are integrated into our products and our products may contain\\ntechnologies
        provided to us by these third parties. we may have little or no ability to
        determine in advance whether any such technology infringes the intellectual
        property rights of others. our\\nvendors, contractors and suppliers may not
        be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted
        against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum\\namount,
        above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages. legal
        challenges to these intellectual property rights may impair our ability to
        use the products and technologies that we\\nneed in order to operate our business
        and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition
        and results of operations. for example, in february 2012 and september 2013,
        viasat and\\nits subsidiary viasat communications filed lawsuits in the u.s.
        district court for the southern district of california against ss/l, the manufacturer
        of echostar xvii and echostar xix. viasat alleges,\\namong other things, that
        ss/l infringes six different patents, and has breached its contractual obligations
        through the use of such patented technology to manufacture echostar\u00a0xvii,\\nechostar\u00a0xix
        and other satellites. while we are not a named party to this matter, an adverse
        decision against ss/l could have a\\nsignificant impact on our business operations
        and impair our ability to make use of echostar\u00a0xvii, echostar xix, or
        other satellites from ss/l. \\n we are party to various lawsuits which, if
        adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on our business,
        particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual property.  \\nwe are subject
        to various legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course
        of our business. many entities, including some of our\\ncompetitors, have
        or may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights
        that cover or affect products or services related to those that we offer.
        in general, if a court determines\\nthat one or more of our products or services
        infringes valid intellectual property rights held by others, we may be required
        to cease developing or marketing those products or services, to obtain\\nlicenses
        from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost, or to redesign
        those products or services in such a way as to avoid infringement. if those
        intellectual property rights are\\nheld by a competitor, we may be unable
        to license the necessary intellectual property rights at any price, which
        could adversely affect our competitive position. please see further discussion

        destruction of such networks, systems or technologies may\\ndisrupt or harm
        our business.  \\nthe capacity, reliability and security of our information
        technology hardware and software infrastructure are important to the operation
        of our\\ncurrent business, which would suffer in the event of system disruptions
        or failures, such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms
        or other destructive or disruptive software,\\nprocess breakdowns, denial
        of service attacks or other malicious activities. our networks and those of
        our third-party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to these
        attacks and\\nunauthorized access. persons who circumvent security measures
        could wrongfully obtain or use information on the network or cause interruptions,
        delays or malfunctions in our operations, any of which\\ncould have a material
        adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
        we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the
        threat of security\\nbreaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational
        harm and litigation, caused by any breaches. although we have implemented
        and intend to continue to implement industry-standard security\\nmeasures,
        these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and
        delays that could lower network operations center availability and have a

        of operations. likewise, our ability to expand and update our information
        technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs is
        important to the\\ncontinued implementation of our new service offering initiatives.
        our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have
        adverse consequences, which could include the delayed\\nimplementation of
        new offerings, product or service interruptions, and the diversion of development
        resources. \\n if our products contain defects, we could be subject to significant
        costs to correct such defects and our product and network service contracts
        could be delayed or\\ncancelled, which could adversely affect our revenue.  \\nthe
        products and the networks we deploy are highly complex, and some may contain
        defects when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements\\nare released,
        despite testing and our quality control procedures. for example, set-top boxes
        may contain software \"bugs\" that can unexpectedly interfere with their operation.
        defects may also occur in\\ncomponents and products that we purchase from
        third parties. in addition, many of our products and network services are
        designed to interface with our customers'' existing networks, each of which

        \\ntable of contents\\n risks related to the regulation of our business  \\n
        our business is subject to risks of adverse government regulation.  \\nour
        business is subject to varying degrees of regulation in the u.s. by the fcc,
        and other entities, and in foreign countries by similar entities and\\ninternationally
        by the itu. these regulations are subject to the political process and do
        change from time to time. moreover, a substantial number of foreign countries
        in which we have, or may in the\\nfuture make, an investment, regulate, in
        varying degrees, the ownership of satellites and the distribution and ownership
        of programming services and foreign investment in telecommunications companies.\\nviolations
        of laws or regulations may result in various sanctions including fines, loss
        of authorizations and the denial of applications for new authorizations or
        for the renewal of existing\\nauthorizations. further material changes in
        law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated, and there can be no assurance
        that our business and the business of our affiliates will not be\\nadversely
        affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation. \\n our business
        depends on regulatory authorizations issued by the fcc and state and foreign
        regulators, that can expire, be revoked or modified, and applications for
        licenses\\nand other authorizations that may not be granted.  \\ngenerally
        all satellite, earth stations and other licenses granted by the fcc and most
        other countries are subject to expiration unless renewed by\\nthe regulatory
        agency. our licenses are currently set to expire at various times. in addition,
        we occasionally receive special temporary authorizations that are granted
        for limited periods of time\\n(e.g.,\u00a0180\u00a0days or less) and subject
        to possible renewal. generally, our licenses and special temporary authorizations
        have been renewed on a routine basis, but there can be no assurance\\nthat
        this will continue. there can be no assurance that the fcc or other regulators
        will continue granting applications for new earth stations or for the renewal
        of existing ones. if the fcc or other\\nregulators were to cancel, revoke,
        suspend, or fail to renew any of our licenses or authorizations, or fail to
        grant our applications for fcc or other licenses, it could have a material
        adverse effect\\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nspecifically,
        loss of a frequency authorization would reduce the amount of spectrum available
        to us, potentially reducing the amount of services we provide to our customers.
        the significance of such a\\nloss of authorizations would vary based upon,
        among other things, the orbital location, the frequency band and the availability
        of a replacement spectrum. in addition, congress and political bodies in\\nother
        countries often consider legislation that could affect us and enact legislation
        that does affect us, and fcc proceedings to implement the communications act,
        as well as other regulatory\\nproceedings in foreign countries, and the enforcement
        of their regulations is ongoing. we cannot predict the outcomes of these legislative
        or regulatory proceedings or their effect on our business. \\nin\\naddition,
        third parties have or may oppose some of our license applications and pending
        and future requests for extensions, modifications, waivers and approvals of
        our licenses. even if we have\\nfully complied with all of the required reporting,
        filing and other requirements in connection with our authorizations, it is
        possible a regulator could decline to grant certain of our applications or\\nrequests
        for authority, or could revoke, terminate, condition or decline to modify,
        extend or renew certain of our authorizations or licenses. \\n our ability
        to sell our digital set-top boxes to certain operators depends on our ability
        to obtain licenses to use the conditional access systems utilized by these\\noperators.  \\nour
        commercial success in selling our digital set-top boxes to cable television
        and other operators depends significantly on our ability to obtain\\nlicenses
        to use the conditional access systems deployed by these operators in our digital
        set-top boxes. in many cases, the intellectual property rights to these conditional
        access systems are owned\\nby the set-top box manufacturer that currently
        provides the system operator with its set-top boxes. we cannot assure you
        that we will be able to obtain required \\n34\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\nlicenses\\non
        commercially favorable terms, or at all. if we do not obtain the necessary
        licenses, we may be delayed or prevented from pursuing the development of
        some potential products with cable or\\nother television operators. our failure
        to obtain a license to use the conditional access systems that we may require
        to develop or commercialize our digital set-top boxes with cable television
        or\\nother operators, in turn, would harm our ability to grow our customer
        base and revenue. \\n we may face difficulties in accurately assessing and
        collecting contributions towards the universal service fund.  \\nas a provider
        of telecommunications services in the u.s., we are presently required to contribute
        a fee, which is based upon a percentage of our\\nrevenue from telecommunications
        services, to the universal service fund to support mechanisms that subsidize
        the provision of services to low-income consumers, high-cost areas, schools,
        libraries and\\nrural health care providers. this percentage is set each calendar
        quarter by the fcc. current fcc rules permit us to pass this universal service
        fund contribution onto our customers. \\nbecause\\nour customer contracts
        often include both telecommunications services, which create such support
        obligations, and other goods and services, which do not, it can be difficult
        to determine which\\nportion of our revenue forms the basis for this contribution
        and the amount that we can recover from our customers. if the fcc, which oversees
        the support mechanisms, or a court or other governmental\\nentity were to
        determine that we computed our contribution obligation incorrectly or passed
        the wrong amount onto our customers, we could become subject to additional
        assessments, liabilities, or\\nother financial penalties. in addition, the
        fcc is considering substantial changes to its universal service fund contribution
        and distribution rules. these changes could impact our future contribution\\nobligations
        and those of third parties that provide communication services to our business.
        any such change to the universal service fund contribution rules could adversely
        affect our costs of\\nproviding service to our customers. in addition, changes
        to the universal service fund distribution rules could intensify the competition
        we face by offering subsidies to competing firms and/or\\ntechnologies. \\n

        common stock held by mr.\u00a0ergen into class\u00a0a common stock) and possesses
        approximately 80.8% of the total voting power. mr.\u00a0ergen''s beneficial
        ownership of us\\nexcludes 5,738,471 shares of our class\u00a0a common stock
        issuable upon conversion of shares of our class\u00a0b common stock currently
        held by certain trusts established by mr.\u00a0ergen for\\nthe benefit of

        held by such trusts into\\nclass\u00a0a common stock) and possess approximately
        11.0% of our total voting power. thus, mr.\u00a0ergen has the ability to elect
        a majority of our directors and to control all other matters\\nrequiring the
        approval of our stockholders. as a result of mr.\u00a0ergen''s voting power,
        we are a \"controlled company\"\\nas defined in the nasdaq listing rules and,

        the executive\\nofficers and the members of our board of directors who overlap
        with dish network also have fiduciary duties to dish network''s shareholders.
        therefore, these individuals may have actual or apparent\\nconflicts of interest
        with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. for example,
        there is potential for a conflict of interest when we or dish network look
        at acquisitions and other\\ncorporate opportunities that may be suitable for
        both companies. in addition, many of our directors and officers own dish network
        stock and options to purchase dish network stock, certain of which\\nthey
        acquired or were granted prior to the spin-off, including mr.\u00a0ergen.
        furthermore, dish network will hold shares of preferred tracking stock of
        us and hss that in the aggregate represents\\nan 80.0% economic interest in
        our residential retail satellite broadband business. these ownership interests

        chairman is employed by both dish network and us.  \\n\u0095intercompany agreements
        related to the\\nspin-off.\u00a0\u00a0we entered into agreements with dish
        network pursuant to which it provides us certain management, administrative,
        accounting,\\ntax, legal and other services, for which we pay dish network
        an amount equal to dish network''s cost plus a fixed margin. in addition,
        we entered into a number of intercompany agreements covering\\nmatters such
        as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken
        by dish network for certain of our businesses. we also entered into certain
        commercial agreements with\\ndish network. the terms of certain of these agreements
        were established while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of dish network and
        were not the result of arm''s length negotiations. the allocation of\\nassets,
        liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations between dish network
        and us under the separation and ancillary agreements we entered into with
        dish network did not necessarily\\nreflect what two unaffiliated parties might
        have agreed to. had these agreements been negotiated with unaffiliated third
        parties, their terms may have been more favorable, or less favorable, to us.
        in\\naddition, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension
        or renegotiation of these existing agreements.   \\n\u0095additional intercompany\\ntransactions.\u00a0\u00a0dish

        with us or our subsidiaries or other\\naffiliates. although the terms of any
        such transactions will be established based upon negotiations between dish
        network and us and, when appropriate, subject to the approval of committee
        of the\\nnon-interlocking directors or in certain instances non-interlocking
        management, there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions
        will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries or\\naffiliates as may otherwise
        be obtained in negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.   \\n\u0095competition
        for business\\nopportunities.\u00a0\u00a0dish network retains its interests
        in various companies that have subsidiaries or controlled affiliates that
        own or\\noperate domestic or foreign services that may compete with services
        offered by our businesses. in addition, pursuant to a distribution agreement,
        dish network has the right, but not the obligation, to\\nmarket, sell and
        distribute our hughes segment''s broadband internet service under the dishnet
        brand which could \\n\\n36\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ntable of contents\\n\\n\\ncompete\\nwith

        with viasat, a competitor of our hughes segment, to sell services similar
        to those offered by our hughes\\nsegment. we may also compete with dish network
        when we participate in auctions for spectrum or orbital slots for our satellites.
        \\n\\n\\nwe\\nmay not be able to resolve any potential conflicts of interest
        with dish network and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable
        to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated\\nparty. \\nexcept\\nfor
        the dish digital joint venture agreements that we entered into with dish network
        in 2012, which, subject to certain exceptions, limits dish network''s and
        our ability to operate an iptv\\nservice other than that operated by dish
        digital, we do not have any agreements with dish network that would prevent
        us from competing with each other. however, many of our potential customers
        have\\nhistorically perceived us as a competitor due to our affiliation with
        dish network. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering
        into any commercial relationships with potential\\ncustomers who are competitors
        of dish network (particularly if we continue to be perceived as affiliated
        with dish network as a result of common ownership and certain shared management

        are a mining company with one mineral claim (the plandel gold claim) in the
        republic of the philippines. our goal is to generate revenues through the
        sale of gold found and extracted from this claim. we have a specific business
        plan to complete exploration work on this claim and have no reason to alter
        this plan within the next twelve months.\u00a0 the company has no subsidiaries,
        affiliates or joint venture partners.\u00a0 due to the depressed markets for
        gold and the difficulties raising capital for mining projects we are also
        exploring the possibility of a acquisition or merger with another company.\u00a0\u00a0we\u00a0\u00a0have
        not been involved in any large purchases other than that of the plandel gold

        our name to sports asylum, inc.\\n\u00a0\\nwe raised $30,000 in initial capital
        in order to identify and purchase a promising mineral property claim.\u00a0pursuant
        to regulation s of the securities act of 1933, on march 31, 2010, sports asylum
        sold 30,000,000 shares of its common stock in a private placement for the
        $30,000. on february 21, 2012, the company issued 1,000,000 common shares
        to an officer at a price of $0.03 per share for a total consideration of $30,000.\\n\u00a0\\nprior
        to our actual incorporation, our former president mario gregorio acquired
        the plandel gold claim from rojas ventures ltd., an unrelated company, on
        july 2, 2009 for the sum of $5,000.\u00a0 this is our only mineral claim.
        it was conveyed by him to us upon our formation on march 19, 2010.\\n\\n\\nin
        july 2009, we engaged a mining consultant, roberto noga, to develop a preliminary
        scoping study for the development of the plandel claim.\u00a0 previous exploration

        viable ore body.\u00a0 there is no guarantee that gold of significant value

        gold claim is accessible from plandel by travelling on the country\u2019s
        only highway system which consists of, for the most part, one lane in each
        direction and by taking an all weather gravel road.\u00a0 plandel gold claim
        lies in a non-active seismic area.\u00a0 the mineral deposit was formed in
        the so-called carbon period, some 350 million years ago.\u00a0 during this
        period, large shallow marshes were formed with abundant vegetation.\u00a0
        the rotting plants and trees in these marshes turned into peat and later into
        coal.\u00a0 the town still has large coal reserves, which is the basis for
        the city\u2019s current coal mining industry.\\n\\n\\nthe philippines is situated
        between 5 and 22 degrees north latitude.\u00a0 this means the country falls
        within the so-called tropical climate zone, a zone characterized by high temperatures
        the whole year round, relatively high rainfall and lush vegetation.\u00a0
        rainfall on the city can occur in\u00a0every month, but the wettest months
        are october, november and december.\u00a0 annual rainfall is approximately
        1.5 metres.\u00a0 due to the steep, deforested mountains, around 60 percent
        of the rainwater runs quickly to the sea.\u00a0 the remaining 40 percent partly
        evaporates and partly seeps through to the island\u2019s underground water
        aquifer.\\n\\n\\nplandel gold claim\u2019s area has an experienced work force
        and will provide all the necessary services needed for an exploration and

        of shell and eroded sand formed the basis for the limestone, which makes up
        most of the philippines.\u00a0 this limestone was, over the ages, pushed upwards
        making it possible to find today sea fossils high in the country\u2019s mountains.\u00a0
        this pushing up continues today.\u00a0 it is caused by the fact that the philippine
        plate, on which most of the country lies, is\u00a0slowly diving under the
        eurasian plate of the mainland asia.\\n\\n\\nthe philippines are characterized
        by steep mountains without any substantial forest cover.\u00a0 highest peaks
        reach over 1,000 meters.\u00a0 the island is 300 km long and 35 km wide.\u00a0
        erosion is a problem as there is a lack of forest cover on the high, steep
        mountains.\\n\\n\\nthe island has vast copper, gold and coal reserves which
        are mined mainly in the central part.\\n\\n\\nduring the 1990\u2019s several

        limestone, iron ore, quartzo-feldspathic veins and basic intrusive such as
        dolerites and anorthosites.\u00a0 coastal zones contain sedimentary limestones,

        are sporadically capped with laterites and bauxites of residual nature.\u00a0
        gypsum and phosphatic nodules occur as sedimentary veins in rocks of the cretaceous
        age.\u00a0 gypsum of secondary replacement occurs in some of the areas adjoining
        the foot hills of the western ghats.\u00a0 lignite occurs as sedimentary beds
        of tertiary age.\u00a0 the black granite and other hard rocks are amenable

        into the atmosphere to fall back as pyroclastics or tuff. this is opposed
        to intrusive rock formation, in which magma does not reach the surface. the
        main effect of extrusion is that the magma can cool much more quickly in the
        open air or under seawater, and there is little time for the growth of crystals.
        often, a residual portion of the matrix fails to crystallize at all, instead

        jewelry, and other arts since the beginning of recorded history. the metal
        occurs as nuggets or grains in rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits. gold
        is dense, soft, shiny and the most malleable and ductile pure metal known.
        pure gold has a bright yellow color and luster traditionally considered attractive,
        which it maintains without oxidizing in air or water. gold is one of the coinage
        metals and has served as a symbol of wealth and a store of value throughout

        may lead to faulty corporate governance .\\n\u00a0\\nwe have only one director
        and executive officer who makes all the decisions regarding corporate governance.\u00a0
        this includes his (executive) compensation, accounting overview, related party
        transactions and so on.\u00a0 he will also have full control over matters
        that require board of directors approval. this may introduce conflicts of
        interest and prevent the segregation of executive duties from those that require
        board of directors approval.\u00a0 this may lead to ineffective disclosure
        and accounting controls.\u00a0 noncompliance with laws and regulations may
        result in fines and penalties.\u00a0 he would have the ability to take any
        action as he himself reviews them and approves them.\u00a0 he would exercise
        control over all matters requiring shareholder approval including significant
        corporate transactions.\u00a0 we have not implemented various corporate governance
        measures nor have we adopted any independent committees as we presently do
        not have any independent directors.\\n\\n\\nour executive officer has other

        he has been devoting and in the future plan to devote only 10 hours per month
        to company affairs which may lead to sporadic exploration activities and periodic
        interruptions of business operations.\u00a0 unforeseen events may cause this
        amount of time to become even less.\u00a0our officers may also have conflicts
        of interest as a result of their relationships with other companies.\u00a0\u00a0see\u201ddirectors

        of key personnel.\u00a0 we will have to compete with other companies both
        within and outside the mining industry to recruit and retain competent employees.\u00a0
        if we cannot maintain qualified employees to meet the needs of our anticipated
        growth, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
        condition.\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\nwe

        if we cannot generate any profits, you may lose your entire investment.\\n\\n\\nwe
        are a recently formed company and have yet to generate any revenues. no profits
        have been made to date and if we fail to make any then we may fail as a business
        and an investment in our common stock will be worth nothing.\u00a0 we have
        no operating history and thus no way for you to measure progress or potential
        future success.\u00a0 success has yet to be proved. currently, there are no
        operations in place to produce revenue.\u00a0 we have yet to find or produce
        sellable product. financial losses should be expected to continue in the near
        future and at least until such time that we enter the production stage.\u00a0
        as a new business we face all the risks of a \u2018start-up\u2019 venture
        including unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, and management limitations
        and difficulties.\u00a0 since inception, we have an accumulated deficit\u00a0of
        $83,295. there is no guarantee, unfortunately, that we may ever be able to
        turn a profit or locate additional opportunities, hire additional management
        and other personnel.\\n\u00a0\\nwe need to acquire additional financing or
        our company will fail.\\n\\n\\nwe must obtain additional capital or our business
        will fail. in order to explore the claim and eventually establish operations,
        we must secure more funds. currently, we have very limited resources and have
        already accumulated a net loss.\u00a0unless we complete the planned exploration
        work on the plandel gold\u00a0claim and commence\u00a0operations, we will
        make no money, which may result in complete loss of your investment.\u00a0
        financing is also needed to bring product to market.\u00a0 financing may be
        subject to numerous factors including investor sentiment, acceptance of mining
        claims and so on.\u00a0 we currently have no arrangements for additional financing.\u00a0
        we may also have to borrow large sums of money that require substantial capital
        and interest payments. we must perform mineral explorations on the plandel
        gold claim to determine if any ore reserves are present and to keep the property
        in good standing. the planned exploration work alone is expected to cost $40,000.
        on may 31, 2014, we had cash of $1,201.\\n\\n\\nthe probability of a mineral
        claim having profitable reserves is very rare and our claim, even with large
        investments, may never generate a profit.\\n\\n\\nwe are dependent upon our
        mining property for success.\u00a0 all anticipated future revenues would come
        directly from the plandel gold claim.\u00a0 should we fail to extract and
        sell gold from this property, our business will fail.\u00a0 mineral deposit
        estimates are imprecise and subject to error,\u00a0and resource calculations
        when made may prove unreliable.\u00a0 assumptions made regarding the supporting
        data may prove inaccurate and unforeseen events may lead to further inaccuracies.\u00a0
        sample variability, mining and processing adjustments, environmental changes,
        metal price fluctuations, and law and regulation changes are all factors that
        could lead to deviances from the original estimations. no assurances can be
        given that any mineral deposit estimate will ever be reclassified as a reserve.\u00a0
        we have no known ore reserves.\u00a0 despite future investment in exploration
        activities, there is no guarantee we will locate a commercially viable ore
        reserve.\u00a0 most exploration projects do no result in discovery of commercially
        mineable deposits.\u00a0with little capital available, we will have to limit
        our exploration which decreases the chances of finding a commercially viable
        ore body. even if gold is identified, the plandel gold claim may not be put
        into production due to high extraction costs, low gold prices, or inadequate
        amount and reduced recovery rates.\u00a0 if the exploration activities do
        not suggest a commercially successful prospect then we may altogether abandon
        plans to develop the property.\\n\\n\\nthe exploration and prospecting of
        minerals is speculative and extremely competitive which may make success difficult.\\n\\n\\nwe
        face strong competition from other mining companies for the acquisition of
        new properties.\u00a0 new properties increase the probability of discovering
        a profitable reserve.\u00a0 most companies have greater financial and managerial
        resources than we do and can acquire and explore attractive new mining properties.\u00a0
        we will face similar difficulties raising new capital to expand operations
        against the larger, better capitalized competitors.\u00a0limited supply and
        unforeseen demand from larger, more competitive companies may make secure
        all necessary equipment and materials difficult and may result in periodic
        interruptions or even business failure. success depends on a combination of
        many factors including but not limited to: the quality of management, technical
        (geological) expertise, quality of land available for exploration and the
        capital available for exploration.\\n\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0
        \\n\\n\\ninternational operations in the philippines are subject to inherent
        risks.\\n\\n\\npolitical instability, uncertainty of the economic climate,
        currency fluctuations, exchange controls and taxation laws may be significant.
        access to all of the equipment, supplies and materials necessary to begin
        exploration may not be available and delay such activity.\u00a0 we have not
        yet attempted to locate or negotiate with any suppliers of products, equipment
        or materials but plan to do so when exploration begins.\u00a0 exchange rate
        changes between the\u00a0\u00a0php and the u.s. dollar may also adversely
        affect success.\\n\u00a0\\nour future operations may be adversely affected
        by future governmental and environmental regulations and permitting.\\n\\n\\nenvironmental
        regulations may negatively affect the progression of operations and these
        regulations may become stricter in the future. in the philippines, all mining
        is regulated by federal and provincial level government agencies. obtaining
        licenses and permits from these agencies as well as an environmental impact
        study for each mining property must be completed before starting mining activities.
        these are expensive and affect the timing of operations.\u00a0 pollution can
        be anticipated with mining activities.\u00a0 if we are unable to comply with
        current or future regulations, this may expose us to fines, penalties and
        litigation that could cause our business to fail.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\nwe are
        subject to inherent mining hazards and risks that may result in future financial
        obligations.\\n\\n\\nrisks and hazards associated with the mining industry
        may adversely affect our operations such as but not limited to: political
        and country risks, industrial accidents, labor disputes, inability to retain
        necessary personnel or equipment, environmental hazards, unexpected geologic
        formations, cave-ins, landslides, flooding and monsoons, fires, explosions,
        power outages, processing problems.\u00a0 personal injury and death could
        result as well as property damage, delays in mining, environmental damage,
        legal liability and monetary loss.\u00a0 we may not be able to obtain insurance
        to cover these risks at economically reasonable premiums.\u00a0we do not carry
        any sort of insurance and may have difficulties obtaining such once operations
        start as insurance is generally sparse and cost prohibitive.\\n\\n\\nrisks

        through the offering of more shares but doing so will dilute those shares
        issued and outstanding .\\n\\n\\nraising additional capital through future
        offerings of common stock may be necessary for our company to continue, but
        there is no guarantee that this will be possible.\u00a0 doing so will, however,
        dilute the total share number issued and outstanding. financing may be achieved
        by issuing more shares which will increase the number of common shares outstanding.\u00a0
        this may decrease the percentage interest held by each of our shareholders.\u00a0obtaining
        financing through the sale of our common stock will dilute other shareholders\u2019
        interests.\u00a0 as the total number of outstanding common shares will increase,
        the equity attached to any individual share will decrease causing a dilution
        of shareholder ownership over the company.\u00a0 with little other access
        to funds currently, we may have to rely on this method substantially to raise
        additional capital.\\n\u00a0\\nthere is a limited market for our common stock
        meaning that you may not be able to resell your shares .\\n\\n\\nour common
        stock currently has a limited market which may restrict shareholders\u2019
        ability to resell them or use them as collateral. thus, the shareholder may
        have to sell their shares privately which may prove very difficult.\u00a0
        private sales are more difficult and often give lower than anticipated prices.\\n\\n\\nshould
        a larger public market develop for our stock, future sales of shares may negatively
        affect their market price.\\n\\n\\neven if a larger market develops, the shares
        may be sparsely traded and have wide share price fluctuations.\u00a0 if we
        succeed in receiving a quotation, the liquidity of the stock may be low despite
        there being a market, making it difficult to get a return on the investment.\u00a0
        the price also depends on potential investor\u2019s feelings regarding the
        results of our operations, the competition of other companies\u2019 shares,
        mineral prices, our ability to generate future revenues, and market perception

        ability to buy and sell their shares as broker-dealers may be less likely
        to engage in transactions of our common shares.\u00a0 a penny stock generally
        includes any non-nasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than
        $5.00 per share.\u00a0 our common stock is expected to trade well below that
        mark.\u00a0 rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 under the exchange act impose sale practice

        of an antenna platform in relation to the earth. microprocessors and our proprietary
        stabilization and control software use that data to compute the antenna movement
        necessary for the antenna''s motors to point the antenna properly and maintain
        contact with the satellite. if an obstruction temporarily blocks the satellite
        signal, our products continue to track the satellite''s location according
        to the movement of the antenna platform in order to carry out automatic, rapid
        reacquisition of the signal when a direct line of sight to the satellite is
        restored.our certified support network offers our tracvision and tracphone
        customers an international network of skilled technical dealers and support
        centers in many locations where our customers are likely to travel. we have
        selected distributors based on their technical expertise, professionalism
        and commitment to quality and regularly provide them with extensive training
        in the sale, installation and support of our products.3table of contents we
        offer a broad array of products to address the needs of a variety of customers
        seeking mobile communications in maritime, land mobile and aeronautical applications.maritime.
        in the marine market, we offer a range of mobile satellite tv and communications
        products.  satellite tv. our tracvision hd-series satellite tv antennas are
        designed to offer a high definition tv experience comparable to what a home
        directv hdtv subscriber would enjoy.  our tracvision hd7 uses a 61-cm diameter
        satellite tv antenna to receive signals from two directv ka-band satellites
        and one directv ku-band satellite simultaneously.  it includes an internet
        protocol enabled antenna control unit as well as optional antenna control
        via a free tracvision application for use on an apple iphone.  we believe
        the tracvision hd7 was the first marine antenna to offer this combination
        of capabilities. our tracvision hd11 uses a 1-meter diameter antenna to receive
        all ku-band and directv ka-band satellite television signals without changing
        out hardware elements. the ku-band will work with any modern satellite television
        service in the world. the ka-band will receive directv hdtv.  like the tracvision
        hd7, it features a customer application for the apple iphone or ipad to enable
        easy control of the system. our tracvision m-series satellite tv antennas
        are designed with the full spectrum of vessel sizes in mind, ranging from
        recreational vessels as small as 20 to 25 feet to large commercial vessels.
        the award-winning family of marine tracvision products include the 32-cm diameter
        tracvision m1, 37-cm diameter tracvision m3, 45-cm diameter tracvision m5,
        60-cm diameter tracvision m7, and 81.3-cm in diameter tracvision m9, each
        of which employs a high-efficiency circular antenna. these products are compatible
        with ku-band hdtv programming as well as high-powered regional satellite tv
        services around the globe, based on available signal strength and antenna
        size requirements.satellite phone & internet. our mini-vsat broadband network
        offers an end-to-end solution for offshore connectivity. this unified c/ku-band
        broadband service enables us to offer commercial, leisure and government customers
        an integrated hardware and service solution for mobile communications and
        seamless region-to-region roaming.  we design and manufacture the onboard
        tracphone terminals, own the hub equipment installed in leased earth stations,
        lease the satellite capacity, manage the network, and provide 24/7/365 after-sale
        support. because we manufacture the onboard hardware, we can integrate the
        full rack of discrete below decks equipment typically used on traditional
        vsat systems into a single, streamlined unit that is significantly easier
        to deploy than competing vsat solutions.  our mini-vsat broadband network
        utilizes arclight spread spectrum modem technology, developed by viasat. this
        spread spectrum approach reduces the broadcast power requirements and the
        pointing accuracy necessary to track the high-bandwidth c and ku-band satellites
        that carry the service.  the resulting efficiencies allowed us to develop
        and bring to market our tracphone terminals.  our 60-cm diameter tracphone
        v7 ku-band antenna is 85% smaller by volume and 75% lighter than alternative
        1-meter vsat antennas.  our 37-cm diameter tracphone v3 ku-band antenna is
        practical for use on smaller vessels as well as land vehicles.  we believe
        that the tracphone v3 is the smallest maritime vsat system currently available.  our
        dual-mode tracphone v11 antenna seamlessly tracks both c- and ku-band satellites,
        making it the only 1-meter maritime vsat antenna to deliver seamless, fully
        global coverage outside of the far polar regions.  in june 2013, we introduced
        our new tracphone v-ip series product line for the mini-vsat broadband network,
        which is an upgrade to the existing tracphone v-series, enabling easier installation
        along with network management tools and multicast reception.we offer a variety
        of rate plans that typically require an initial commitment of one or more
        years with a one year auto renewal feature.  fixed rate plan prices vary depending
        on the data rate, and while customers can consume unlimited data, there are
        restrictions over the use of certain protocols such as those that stream video
        content.  metered plans are billed monthly based on the amount of data consumed.  introduced
        in 2013, unrestricted plan prices vary depending on a minimum monthly data
        quota with the ability to add more data for an incremental charge.  unrestricted
        plans allow users to consume unlimited data with no protocol restrictions,
        meaning customers can stream video content to their vessels or use popular
        voice services like skype\u2122.the high bandwidth offered by the ku-band
        satellites also permits faster data rates than those supported by inmarsat''s
        l-band satellites. tracphone v7-ip and v11-ip customers may select service
        packages with internet data connections offering ship-to-shore satellite data
        rates as fast as 1 megabits per second or mbps, and shore-to-ship satellite
        data rates as fast as 4 mbps. the tracphone v3-ip, due to its smaller dish
        diameter, offers ship-to-shore data rates as fast as 128 kilobits per second,
        or kbps, and shore-to-ship satellite data rates as fast as 2 mbps. in addition,
        subscriptions include voice over internet protocol (voip) telephone services
        optimized for use over satellite connections. the tracphone v7-ip and v11-ip
        can support two or more simultaneous calls while the tracphone v3-ip can support
        one call at a time.our mini-vsat broadband network currently uses a combination
        of 19 ku-band and three global c-band transponders to provide coverage throughout
        the northern hemisphere and all of the major continents in the southern hemisphere.
        we currently offer our ku-band mini-vsat broadband service in the americas,
        europe, the middle east, africa, asia-pacific, and australian and new zealand
        waters. it is our long-term plan to continue to invest in and enhance the
        mini-vsat broadband 4table of contents network in cooperation with viasat
        under the terms of a 10-year agreement announced in july 2008. in april and
        july 2013, we more than doubled our mini-vsat broadband network capacity in
        brazil, africa and the asia-pacific region, following the upgrades in the
        caribbean and the european and middle eastern regions in late 2012. under
        the terms of our revenue sharing arrangement with viasat, these types of expansions
        position us to earn revenue not only from the maritime and land-based use
        of the mini-vsat broadband service but also from aeronautical applications
        that roam throughout our network.we are actively engaged in sales efforts
        for the tracphone v- ip series and mini-vsat broadband service to government
        agencies for maritime, military, and emergency responder use. in september
        2010, the u.s. coast guard awarded us a 10-year, up to $42 million contract
        to supply tracphone v7 systems and mini-vsat broadband airtime to as many
        as 216 u.s. coast guard cutters. as of december 31, 2013, we have supplied
        tracphone v7 systems for approximately 125 u.s. coast guard vessels. we are
        also taking steps to expand our ability to support the commercial maritime
        market. in march 2011, we signed a contract to provide tracphone v7 and mini-vsat
        broadband service to vroon b.v. and its fleet of more than 125 commercial
        vessels, as of december 31, 2013, approximately 100 systems have shipped.
        in march 2012, v.ships, the world''s largest independent ship manager serving
        a fleet of over 1,000 vessels, selected our mini-vsat broadband service as
        its preferred satellite communications solution.  in june 2012, tokyo-based
        shipping and logistics company, nippon yusen kaisha (nyk line), selected our
        tracphone v7 and mini-vsat broadband service, as of december 31, 2013, approximately
        120 systems have shipped.in september 2010, we acquired virtek communication,
        a norwegian firm that developed commbox, a ship-to-shore network management
        product. commbox, which comprises shipboard hardware, a kvh-hosted or privately
        owned shore-based hub, and a suite of software applications, offers a range
        of tools designed to increase communication efficiency, reduce costs, and
        manage network operations. key functions include web and data compression
        and optimization to increase network capacity; remote pc management for customer
        it departments; integrated e-mail, web compression, firewalls, and security;
        least-cost routing; and bandwidth management on multiple communication carriers.
        commbox is offered as an option for all tracphone v series and tracphone v-ip
        series products (tracphone vsat products) and for our inmarsat-compatible
        tracphone and iridium openport systems. commbox sales include both the shipboard
        hardware and optional private shore-based hub, subscriptions to the selected
        software applications, and monthly system maintenance fees.we offer iridium
        openport hardware and service to be used in conjunction with our mini-vsat
        service. iridium openport service provides data rates up to 128kpbs and covers
        the entire world, including the polar regions. we offer the iridium hardware
        and service along with our own mini-vsat solution and our commbox, which will
        switch over to the iridium service if the mini-vsat service is not available.
        our customers might choose to add the iridium service to expand the geographic
        coverage of the system, or as a backup service.  in addition to our tracphone
        vsat products and mini-vsat broadband service, we also offer a family of inmarsat-compatible
        tracphone products that provide in-motion access to global satellite communications.
        these products rely on services offered by inmarsat, a satellite service provider
        that supports links for phone, fax and data communications as fast as 432
        kbps. the tracphone fb150, fb250, and fb500 antennas use the inmarsat fleetbroadband
        service to offer voice as well as high-speed internet service. the tracphone
        fb150, fb250, and fb500 are manufactured by thrane & thrane a/s of denmark
        and distributed on an oem basis by us in north america under the kvh tracphone
        brand and distributed in other markets on a non-exclusive basis. unlike mini-vsat
        broadband, where we control and sell the airtime, we purchase inmarsat and
        iridium airtime from a distributor and resell it to our customers.in may 2013,
        we acquired acquired headland media limited (now known as kvh media group),
        a media and entertainment service company based in the united kingdom that
        distributes commercially-licensed news, sports, music, movies and training
        video content to commercial and leisure customers in the maritime, hotel,
        and/or retail markets.  sales from kvh media group are included in our mobile
        communications services sales.land mobile. we design, manufacture, and sell
        a range of tracvision satellite tv antenna systems for use on a broad array
        of vehicles, including recreational vehicles, buses, conversion vans, and
        automobiles.in the rv/bus market, we offer tracvision satellite tv products,
        intended for both stationary and in-motion use. our tracvision r1 delivers
        directv or dish network service through a small 31.75cm\u201d diameter dome.
        our tracvision a7 uses hybrid phased-array antenna technology to provide in-motion
        reception of satellite tv programming in the continental united states using
        the directv service. the tracvision a7 product includes a mobile satellite
        television antenna and an integrated 12v mobile directv receiver/controller
        designed specifically for the mobile environment by kvh and directv. the tracvision\u00a0a7
        stands approximately five inches high and mounts either to a vehicle''s roof
        rack or directly to the vehicle''s roof, making it practical for use aboard
        minivans, suvs and other passenger vehicles. the tracvision a7 is also popular
        for tall motor coaches and buses. automotive customers subscribe to directv''s
        total choice mobile satellite tv 5table of contents programming package, which
        is specifically promoted for automotive applications. local channels and network
        programming are also available as an option for tracvision a7 users as a result
        of the system''s integrated gps and mobile receiver. at this time, we are
        the only company authorized by directv to sell, promote, and activate mobile
        users for the total choice mobile programming package.aeronautical applications.
        we designed, developed, and manufactured directv-compatible satellite tv antennas
        for use on narrowbody commercial aircraft, such as boeing''s 737 and the airbus
        a320, operating in the united states.guidance and stabilization productswe
        offer a portfolio of digital compass and fiber optic gyro (fog)-based systems
        that address the rigorous requirements of military and commercial customers.
        our systems provide reliable, easy-to-use and continuously available navigation
        and pointing data. our guidance and stabilization products include our inertial
        measurement unit for precision guidance, fogs for tactical navigation as well
        as pointing and stabilization systems, and digital compasses that provide
        accurate heading information for demanding applications.guidance and stabilization.
        our fog products use an all-fiber design that has no moving parts, resulting
        in an affordable combination of precision, accuracy and durability. our fog
        products support a broad range of military applications, including stabilization
        of remote weapons stations, antennas, radar, optical devices or turrets; image
        stabilization and synchronization for shoulder-or tripod-mounted weapon simulators;
        precision tactical navigation systems for military vehicles, and guidance
        for weapons and unmanned autonomous vehicles. our fog products are also used
        in numerous commercial products, such as navigation and positioning systems
        for various applications including precision mapping, dynamic surveying, autonomous
        vehicles, train location control and track geometry measurement systems, industrial
        robotics and optical stabilization.our tg-6000 imu is a guidance system that
        provides precise measurement of motion and acceleration in three dimensions.
        it uses a three-axis configuration of our high-performance dsp-based (digital
        signal processing) fogs integrated with three accelerometers. we believe that
        this configuration provides outstanding performance, high reliability, low
        maintenance and easy system integration. the tg-6000 imu is a component in
        the u.s. navy''s mk54 lightweight torpedo and is suitable for use in other
        applications that involve flight control, orientation, instrumentation and
        navigation, such as unmanned aerial vehicles. the cg-5100, our first commercial-grade
        imu, is focused on a wide range of applications such as 3d augmented reality,
        mobile mapping, platform navigation and gps augmentation for unmanned vehicle
        programs, precise mapping and imagery.our cns-5000 continuous navigation system
        is a self-contained navigation system that combines our fog-based inertial
        measurement technology with gps technology from novatel. this navigation solution
        provides precise position and orientation of a host platform on a continuous
        basis, even during periods where gps signals are blocked by natural or man-made
        obstructions or conditions. the cns-5000 is designed for demanding commercial
        applications, such as dynamic surveying, mobile mapping, precision agriculture,
        container terminal management, and autonomous vehicle navigation, where the
        ability to determine the precise position and orientation of a piece of equipment
        or a mobile platform is critical. the cns-5000 is a commercial-off-the-shelf
        (cots) product consisting of a fog-based inertial measurement unit tightly
        integrated with gps within a single enclosure. this design reduces the operational
        complexities for customers whose products cross international boundaries.our
        open-loop dsp-1750, dsp-3000, and dsp-4000 fogs provide precision measurement
        of the rate and angle of a platform''s turning motion for significantly less
        cost than competing closed-loop gyros. these dsp-based products deliver performance
        superior to analog signal processing devices, which experience greater temperature-sensitive
        drift and rotation errors. applications for these products include inertial
        measurement units, integrated navigation systems, attitude/heading/reference
        systems, and stabilization of antenna, radar and optical equipment.the dsp-1750,
        which we believe to be the world''s smallest high performance fog, is the
        first to use our e\u2022core thinfiber\u00ae technology. this thin fiber,
        which is created at our tinley park, illinois manufacturing facility, is only
        170 microns in diameter, enabling longer lengths of fiber to be wound into
        smaller housings. since the length of the fiber used in a fog directly relates
        to gyro accuracy and performance, this technology enables us to produce smaller
        and more accurate gyros. the small size and weight of the dsp-1750 make it
        well suited for applications with size and weight restrictions, such as night
        vision and thermal imaging systems, aircraft-mounted gimbaled cameras for
        law enforcement and homeland security, and shipboard optical systems.the dsp-3000
        and dsp-3100 are each slightly larger than a deck of playing cards and offers
        a variety of interface options to support a range of applications. high-performance
        2-axis and 3-axis configurations can be realized by integrating multiple dsp-3000
        and dsp-3100 units. currently, the dsp-3000 and dsp-3100 are used in an array
        of pointing and 6table of contents stabilization applications, including the
        u.s. army''s common remotely operated weapon station (crows) to provide the
        image and gun stabilization necessary to ensure that the weapon remains aimed
        at its target. we estimate that more than 20 companies have developed or are
        developing stabilized remote weapons stations that we believe will require
        similar fog stabilization capabilities. the larger, militarized dual axis
        dsp-4000 is designed for use in high-shock and highly dynamic environments,
        such as gun turret stabilization.our 1750 imu is an advanced 6-degrees-of-freedom
        sensor designed to integrate easily into the most demanding stabilization,
        pointing, and navigation applications. it offers enhanced performance at a
        lower cost than competing systems.  the 1750 imu marries the groundbreaking
        e\u2022core thinfiber\u00ae technology of our dsp-1750 fogs with very low
        noise, solid state mems accelerometers to create a commercial-off-the-shelf
        imu.  the 1750 imu offers exceptional precision in a very small form factor,
        making it suitable for applications where space is limited, such as unmanned
        and autonomous systems.  in october 2013, we introduced the new dsp-1760 single-axis
        and multi-axis fogs offerings with improved performance and ease of integration
        relative to the dsp-1750.  many customers using our dsp-1750 single-axis and
        dual-axis fogs also had requirements for packaged dsp-1750s. rather than simply
        designing a housing for the dsp-1750s sensors, we used the 1750 imu housing
        and combined it with an improved dsp-1750 design. the result is the dsp-1760
        product line, consisting of packaged one, two, or three axes of fogs, each
        with two different interface connector options. tactical navigation. our tacnav
        tactical navigation product line employs digital compass sensors and kvh fogs
        to offer vehicle-based navigation and pointing systems with a range of capabilities,
        including gps backup and enhancement, vehicle position, hull azimuth and navigation
        displays. because our digital compass products measure the earth''s magnetic
        field rather than detect satellite signals from the gps, they are not susceptible
        to gps jamming devices.tacnav systems vary in size and complexity to suit
        a wide range of vehicles. our tacnav light is a low-cost, digital compass-based
        battlefield navigation system specifically designed for non-turreted vehicles,
        such as high mobility multi-wheeled vehicles (hmmwvs) and trucks. our tacnav
        tls, a digital compass-based tactical navigation and targeting system, offers
        a fog upgrade for enhanced accuracy designed for turreted vehicles, including
        reconnaissance vehicles, armored personnel carriers and light armored vehicles.
        our tacnav ii fiber gyro navigation system offers a compact design, continuous
        output of heading and pointing data, and a flexible architecture that allows
        it to function as either a stand-alone navigation module or as the central
        component of an expanded, multifunctional navigation system.our navigation
        systems function as standalone tools and also aggregate, integrate and communicate
        critical information from a variety of on-board systems. tacnav can receive
        data from systems such as the vehicle''s odometer, military and commercial
        gps devices, laser rangefinders, turret angle indicators and laser warning
        systems. tacnav can also output this data to an on-board computer for retransmission
        through the vehicle''s communications systems to a digital battlefield management
        application.our tacnav digital compass products have been sold for use aboard
        u.s. army, marine corps, and navy vehicles as well as to many foreign countries,
        including australia, the united kingdom, canada, germany, italy, new zealand,
        saudi arabia, spain, sweden, taiwan, malaysia and switzerland. we believe
        that we are among the leading manufacturers of such systems. our standard
        tacnav products can be customized to our customers\u2019 specifications. at
        customer request, we offer training and other services on a time-and-materials
        basis.sales, marketing and supportour sales, marketing and support efforts
        target markets that are substantial and require dedicated dealers and distributors
        to reach end customers. these channels vary from time to time, but currently
        include targeted efforts to reach the commercial and leisure maritime markets,
        the rv, high-end automotive and bus markets, and the commercial, industrial

        resellers for our mobile satellite communications products and legacy products
        do not carry extensive inventories and rely on us to ship products quickly.
        generally due to the rapid delivery of our commercial products, our backlog
        for those products is not significant.our backlog for all products and services
        was approximately $20.5 million, $35.0 million, and $22.1 million on december\u00a031,
        2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.  as of december 31, 2013, our backlog
        was scheduled for fulfillment in 2014 except for $5.0 million scheduled for
        fulfillment in 2015.  the decrease in backlog of $14.5 million from december
        31, 2012 to december 31, 2013 was primarily a result of the fulfillment of
        the order for tacnav products and services received in june 2012 from sang
        and decreased orders for fogs, partially offset by additional tacnav orders.
        the increase in backlog of $12.9 million from december 31, 2011 to december
        31, 2012 was primarily a result of the order for tacnav products and services
        received in june 2012 from sang.  this increase was partially offset by decreased
        orders for fogs.  backlog consists of orders evidenced by written agreements
        and specified delivery dates for customers who are acceptable credit risks.
        we do not include satellite connectivity or media content service sales in
        our backlog even though many of our satellite connectivity and media content
        customers have signed annual or multi-year service contracts providing for
        a fixed monthly fee. military orders included in backlog are generally subject
        to cancellation for the convenience of the customer. when orders are canceled,
        we generally recover actual costs incurred through the date of cancellation
        and the costs resulting from termination. as of december\u00a031, 2013, our
        backlog included approximately $12.2 million in orders that are subject to
        cancellation for convenience by the customer. individual orders for guidance
        and stabilization products are often large and may require procurement of
        specialized long-lead components and allocation of manufacturing resources.
        the complexity of planning and executing larger orders generally requires
        customers to order well in advance of the required delivery date, resulting
        in backlog.intellectual propertyour ability to compete effectively depends
        to a significant extent on our ability to protect our proprietary information.
        we rely primarily on patents and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures
        and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. we
        own approximately 28 u.s. and foreign patents and have additional patent applications
        that are currently pending. we also register our trademarks in the united
        states and other key markets where we do business. our patents will expire
        at various dates between june 2014 and july 2028. we enter into confidentiality
        agreements with our consultants, key employees and sales representatives,
        and maintain controls over access to and distribution of our technology, software
        and other proprietary information. the steps we have taken to protect our
        technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as
        our technology to compete with us.we do not generally conduct exhaustive patent
        searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes
        patents held by third parties. in addition, product development is inherently
        uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may
        be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when
        filed, with regard to similar technologies.8table of contents from time to
        time, we have faced claims by third parties that our products or technologies
        infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights, and we may face
        similar claims in the future. any claim of infringement could cause us to
        incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is
        invalid, and could distract the attention of our management. if any of our
        products is found to violate third-party proprietary rights, we may be required
        to pay substantial damages. in addition, we may be required to re-engineer
        our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue to
        offer our products. any efforts to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses
        on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful, which would prevent
        us from selling our products, and, in any case, could substantially increase
        our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
        and results of operations.manufacturingmanufacturing operations for our mobile
        satellite communications and navigation products consist of light manufacture,
        final assembly and testing. manufacturing operations for our fog products
        are more complex. we produce specialized optical fiber, fog components and
        sensing coils and combine them with components purchased from outside vendors
        for assembly into finished goods. we own optical fiber drawing towers with
        which we produce the specialized optical fiber that we use in all of our fog
        products. excluding the commbox product, which we manufacture in norway, we
        manufacture, warehouse and distribute our mobile satellite communications
        products at our headquarters in middletown, rhode island. we manufacture our
        navigation and fog products in our facility located in tinley park, illinois.we
        contract with third parties for fabrication and assembly of printed circuit
        boards, injection-molded plastic parts, machined metal components, connectors
        and housings. we believe there are a number of acceptable vendors for the
        components we purchase. we regularly evaluate both domestic and foreign suppliers
        for quality, dependability and cost effectiveness. in some instances we utilize
        sole-source suppliers to develop strategic relationships to enhance the quality
        of materials and save costs. our manufacturing processes are controlled by
        an iso 9001:2008-certified quality standards program.competitionwe encounter
        significant competition in all of our markets, and we expect this competition
        to intensify in the future. many of our primary competitors are well-established
        companies and some have substantially greater financial, managerial, technical,
        marketing, operational and other resources than we do.in the marine market
        for satellite tv equipment, we compete with intellian, cobham satcom, orbit
        communication systems, raymarine (intellian made), kns, and sea king (king
        controls).in the marine market for voice, fax, data and internet communications
        equipment, we compete with intellian, cobham satcom, orbit communication systems,
        jotron as, kns inc., inmarsat, addvalue, and iridium satellite llc.   in the
        marine market for voice, fax, data and internet services, we compete with
        inmarsat, globalstar lp, and iridium satellite llc. we also face competition
        from providers of marine satellite data services and maritime vsat solutions,
        including inmarsat (and its new announced global xpress service), mtn/seamobile,
        speedcast, caprock, and airbus defense & space. in the market for land mobile
        satellite tv equipment, we compete with king controls and winegard company.in
        the markets for media content, we compete with swank motion pictures and newspaperdirect.in
        the markets for mobile satellite communications technology, the principal
        competitive factors are product size, features, design, performance, reliability
        and price. in the markets for media content, the principal competitive factors
        are license rights, distribution and price.in the guidance and stabilization
        markets, we compete primarily with honeywell international inc., northrop
        grumman corporation, goodrich aerospace, iai, fizoptica, sagem and systron
        donner inertial.  we believe the principal competitive factors in these markets
        are performance, size, reliability, durability and price.research and developmentfocused
        investments in research and development are critical to our future growth
        and competitive position in the marketplace. our research and development
        efforts are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products
        and services that are central to our core business strategy. the industries
        in which we compete are subject to rapid technological developments, evolving
        industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and new product and
        service introductions and enhancements. as a result, our success depends in
        part upon our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to
        enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products and
        services that improve performance and meet customers'' operational and cost
        requirements. our current research and development efforts include projects
        to achieve 9table of contents additional cost reductions in our products and
        the development of new products and services for our existing marine and land
        mobile communications markets, and navigation, guidance and stabilization
        application markets. for example:\u2022 in june 2013, we introduced our new
        tracphone v-ip series product line for the mini-vsat broadband network enabling
        easier integration along with network management tools and multicast reception;
        \u2022in october 2013, we introduced the new dsp-1760 single-axis and multi-axis
        fog offerings with improved performance and ease of integration relative to
        the dsp-1750; and\u2022later this year, we plan to offer new value-added services
        to our mini-vsat broadband customers using our ip-mobilecast software. our
        research and development activities consist of projects funded by us, and
        projects funded with the assistance of customer-funded contract research.
        our customer-funded research efforts are made up of contracts with defense
        and oem customers, whose performance specifications are unique to their product
        applications. defense and oem research often results in new product offerings.
        we strive to be the first company to bring a new product to market, and we
        use our own funds to accelerate new product development efforts.government
        regulationour manufacturing operations are subject to various laws governing
        the protection of the environment and our employees. these laws and regulations
        are subject to change, and any such change may require us to improve our technologies,
        incur expenditures, or both, in order to comply with such laws and regulations.we
        are subject to compliance with the u.s. export administration regulations.
        some of our products have military or strategic applications, and are on the
        munitions list of the u.s. international traffic in arms regulations. these
        products require an individual validated license to be exported to certain
        jurisdictions. the length of time involved in the licensing process varies
        and can result in delays of the shipping of the products. sales of our products
        to either the u.s. government or its prime contractors are subject to the
        u.s. federal acquisition regulations.we are also subject to the laws and regulations
        of the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions in which we offer and sell our satellite
        communication products and services, including those of the european union,
        brazil, norway, singapore and japan.\u00a0these laws and regulations, as well
        as the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations, are subject
        to change and any such change may affect our ability to offer and sell existing
        and planned satellite communications products and services.employeeson december\u00a031,
        2013, we employed 471 full-time employees. we also employ part-time employees
        as well as temporary or contract personnel, when necessary, to provide short-term
        and/or specialized support for production and other functional projects.we
        believe our future success will depend upon the continued service of our key
        technical and senior management personnel and upon our continued ability to
        attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. none
        of our employees is represented by a labor union. we have never experienced
        a work stoppage and consider our relationship with our employees to be good.10table
        of contents item\u00a01a.risk factorsan investment in our common stock involves
        a high degree of risk. you should carefully consider the following risk factors
        in evaluating our business. if any of these risks, or other risks not presently
        known to us or that we currently believe are not significant, develops into
        an actual event, then our business, financial condition and results of operations
        could be adversely affected. if that happens, the market price of our common
        stock could decline.our revenues and results of operations have been and may
        continue to be adversely impacted by worldwide economic turmoil, credit tightening,
        high fuel prices and associated declines in consumer spending.worldwide economic
        conditions have experienced a significant downturn over the last several years,
        including slower economic activity, tightened credit markets, inflation and
        deflation concerns, increased fuel prices, decreased consumer confidence,
        reduced corporate profits, reduced or canceled capital spending, adverse business
        conditions and liquidity concerns. these conditions make it difficult for
        businesses, governments and consumers to accurately forecast and plan future
        activities. many governments are experiencing significant deficits that have
        caused and may continue to cause them to curtail spending significantly and/or
        reallocate funds away from defense programs. there can be no assurances that
        government responses to the disruptions in the economy will remedy these problems.
        as a result of these and other factors, customers could continue to slow or
        suspend spending on our products and services. we may also incur increased
        credit losses and need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, which
        would have a negative impact on our earnings and financial condition. for
        example, our bad debt expense increased $0.5 million in 2013 from 2012, driven
        by bad debt expense associated with airtime sales for our mini-vsat broadband
        service. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we cannot predict the timing, duration or
        ultimate impact of the downturn in our markets. we expect our business to
        continue to be adversely impacted by this downturn.net sales of many of our
        mobile communications products are largely generated by discretionary consumer
        spending, and demand for these products may continue to decline as a result
        of continuing weak regional and global economic conditions. for example, sales
        of our mobile communications products decreased 2% from 2012 to 2013, and
        the declines were more extensive in certain areas such as asia and europe.
        consumer spending tends to decline during recessionary periods and may decline
        at other times. some consumers have chosen not to purchase our mobile communications
        products due to a perception that they are luxury items, and these trends
        could continue or accelerate. as global and regional economic conditions change,
        including uncertainty regarding federal budgetary pressures, overseas sovereign
        debt crisis, the general level of interest rates, fluctuating oil prices and
        demand for durable consumer products, demand for our products could continue
        to be materially and adversely affected.our financial performance is impacted
        by u.s. government contracts, which are subject to uncertain levels of funding
        and termination.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  we have historically sold a substantial
        portion of our fog systems to a u.s. government contractor for the u.s. army''s
        crows iii program. a reduction in sales to the u.s. government, whether due
        to lack of funding, for convenience, or otherwise, or the occurrence of delays,
        could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
        we expect that the drawdown of troops from afghanistan will continue to adversely
        affect sales of our fog products to contractors to the u.s. government.  the
        funding of u.s. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations.
        congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a
        program may extend over several fiscal years. consequently, programs are often
        only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as
        congress makes further appropriations. if appropriations  for any program
        in which we participate become unavailable, or are reduced or delayed, our
        contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by
        the government, which could have a negative impact on our future sales under
        such contract or subcontract. when a formal appropriation bill has not been
        signed into law before the end of the u.s. government''s fiscal year, which
        has become more frequent in recent years, congress may pass a continuing resolution
        that authorizes agencies of the u.s. government to continue to operate, generally
        at the same funding levels from the prior year, but that typically does not
        authorize new spending initiatives, during this period. appropriations can
        also be impacted by other budgetary considerations, such as failure to increase
        the statutory debt ceiling of the u.s. government. during such periods (or
        until the regular appropriation bills are passed), delays can occur in procurement
        of products and services due to lack of funding, and these delays can affect
        our results of operations during the period of delay. appropriations can also
        be affected by legislation that addresses larger budgetary issues of the u.s.
        government. for example, future federal sequestration measures could continue
        to adversely affect federal spending across the u.s. government, including
        the department of defense, and we expect that these measures will continue
        to limit or reduce defense spending, including spending for our fog products
        for the u.s. army''s crows iii program. 11table of contents in addition, u.s.
        government contracts generally also permit the government to terminate the
        contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the government''s
        convenience or for default based on performance. if one of our contracts is
        terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for
        our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work
        performed. if one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally
        be entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the government.
        a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and
        adversely affect our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. furthermore,
        on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor,
        the u.s. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or
        otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor.our results
        of operations could be adversely affected if unseasonably cold weather, prolonged
        winter conditions, disasters or similar events occur.our marine leisure business
        is highly seasonal and seasonality can also impact our commercial marine business.
        historically, we have generated the majority of our marine leisure product
        revenues during the first and second quarters of each year, and these revenues
        typically decline in the third and fourth quarters of each year, compared
        to the first two quarters. temporary suspensions of our airtime services typically
        increase in the third and fourth quarters of each year as boats are placed
        out of service during winter months. our marine leisure business is also significantly
        affected by the weather. unseasonably cool weather, prolonged winter conditions,
        hurricanes, unusual amounts of rain, and natural and other disasters may decrease
        boating, which could reduce our revenues. specifically, we may encounter a
        decrease in new airtime activations as well as an increase in the number of
        cancellations or temporary suspensions of our airtime service.we expect that
        we could derive an increasing portion of our revenues from commercial leases
        of mobile communications equipment, rather than sales, which could increase
        our credit and collection risk.we are actively seeking to increase revenues
        from the commercial markets for our mini-vsat broadband service, particularly
        shipping companies and other companies that deploy a fleet of vessels. in
        marketing this service, we offer leasing arrangements for the tracphone antennas
        to both commercial and leisure customers. if commercial leases become increasingly
        popular with our customers, we could face increased risks of default under
        those leases. defaults could increase our costs of collection (including costs
        of retrieving leased equipment) and reduce the amount we collect from customers,
        which could harm our results of operations. moreover, fleet sales are likely
        to be less common than, and perhaps substantially larger than, our typical
        orders, which could lead to increased variability in our quarterly revenues
        and gross margin realization.changes in the competitive environment or supply
        chain issues may require inventory write-downs.from time to time, we have
        recorded significant inventory reserves and/or inventory write-offs as a result
        of substantial declines in customer demand. market or competitive changes
        could lead to future charges for excess or obsolete inventory, especially
        if we are unable to appropriately adjust the supply of material from our vendors.shifts
        in our product sales mix toward our mobile communications products and services
        may reduce our overall gross margins.our mobile communications products and
        services historically have had lower product and service gross margins than
        our guidance and stabilization products. as a result of the completion of
        the product delivery portion of the sang contract and other factors, we expect
        a shift in our sales mix towards mobile communications products and services,
        which would likely cause lower gross margins in the future. moreover, our
        mobile communications services have lower gross margins than our overall average
        gross margins, and those services have been increasing as a percentage of
        net sales.  if and to the extent that our mobile communications services continue
        to increase as a percentage of net sales, we expect to generate lower overall
        gross margins, although this trend may be somewhat offset if we continue to
        generate increased efficiencies of scale in the delivery of our mobile communications
        services.we must generate a certain level of sales of the tracphone v-series
        products and our mini-vsat broadband service in order to improve our service
        gross margins.as a result of our mini-vsat broadband network infrastructure,
        our cost of service sales includes certain fixed costs that do not generally
        vary with the volume of service sales, and we have almost no ability to reduce
        these fixed costs in the short term. these fixed costs will increase if we
        further expand our network to accommodate additional subscriber demand and/or
        coverage area expansion. if sales of our tracphone v-series products and the
        mini-vsat broadband service do not generate the level of revenue that we expect
        or decline, our service gross margins may remain below historical levels or
        decline. the failure to improve our mini-vsat broadband service gross margins
        would have a material adverse effect on our overall profitability.12table
        of contents competition may limit our ability to sell our mobile communications
        products and services and guidance and stabilization products.the mobile communications
        markets and defense navigation, guidance and stabilization markets in which
        we participate are very competitive, and we expect this competition to persist
        and intensify in the future. we may not be able to compete successfully against
        current and future competitors, which could impair our ability to sell our
        products. for example, improvements in the performance of lower cost gyros
        by competitors could potentially jeopardize sales of our fogs. foreign competition
        for our mobile satellite communications products has continued to intensify,
        most notably from companies that seek to compete primarily on price. we anticipate
        that this trend of substantial competition will continue.in the marine market
        for satellite tv equipment, we compete with intellian, cobham satcom, orbit
        communication systems, raymarine (intellian made), kns, and sea king (king
        controls).in the marine market for voice, fax, data and internet communications

        international inc., northrop grumman corporation, goodrich aerospace, iai,
        fizoptica, sagem and systron donner inertial.among the factors that may affect
        our ability to compete in our markets are the following:\u2022many of our
        primary competitors are well-established companies that generally have substantially
        greater financial, managerial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources
        than we do;\u2022product and service improvements, new product and service
        developments or price reductions by competitors may weaken customer acceptance
        of, and reduce demand for, our products and services;\u2022new technology
        or market trends may disrupt or displace a need for our products and services;
        and\u2022our competitors may have lower production costs than we do, which
        may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering discounts and other
        promotions.the emergence of a competing small maritime vsat antenna and complementary
        service or other similar service could reduce the competitive advantage we
        believe we currently enjoy with our 60-centimeter (cm) diameter tracphone
        v7 and 37-cm diameter tracphone v3 antennas along with our integrated ku-band
        mini-vsat broadband service, or with our c/ku-band mini-vsat broadband service
        and our tracphone v11.our tracphone v3 and v7 systems offer customers a range
        of benefits due to their integrated design, hardware costs that are lower
        than existing maritime ku-band vsat systems, and spread spectrum technology.
        we currently compete against companies that offer established maritime ku-band
        vsat service using, in some cases, antennas 1-meter in diameter or larger.
        while we are unaware of any company offering a 37-cm vsat solution comparable
        to our tracphone v3, we are encountering regional competition from companies
        offering 60-cm vsat systems and services, which are comparable in size to
        our tracphone v7. likewise, our tracphone v11, at 1.1-meter in diameter, is
        approximately 85% smaller and lighter than competing c-band maritime vsat
        systems, which uses antennas in excess of 2.4-meters in diameter to provide
        similar global services. we are unaware of any competitor currently offering
        a similar size solution for global c-band coverage, but any introduction of
        such a product could adversely impact our success. in addition, other companies
        could replicate some of the distinguishing features of our tracphone v-series
        products, which could potentially reduce the appeal of our solution, increase
        price competition and adversely affect sales. for example, inmarsat has announced
        a new global ka-band mobile vsat service called global xpress which they claim
        will be faster and have a lower price per megabit than existing ku-band services
        that might adversely impact sales of kvh\u2019s mini-vsat broadband service
        and related equipment. moreover, consumers may choose other services such
        as fleetbroadband or iridium openport for their service coverage and potentially
        lower hardware costs despite higher service costs and slower data rates.13table
        of contents our ability to compete in the maritime airtime services market
        may be impaired if we are unable to provide sufficient service capacity to
        meet customer demand.the tracphone v-series products and our mini-vsat broadband
        service offer a range of benefits to mariners, especially in commercial markets,
        due to the smaller size antenna and faster, more affordable airtime. we have
        completed the rollout of our original network coverage plan and currently
        offer service in the americas, europe, the middle east, africa, asia-pacific,
        and australian and new zealand waters. in the future, we may need to expand
        capacity in existing coverage areas to support an expanding subscriber base.
        if we are unable to reach agreement with third-party satellite providers to
        support the mini-vsat broadband service and its spread spectrum technology
        or transponder capacity is unavailable should we need to increase our capacity
        to meet growing demand in a given region, our ability to support vessels and
        aeronautical applications globally will be at risk and could reduce the attractiveness
        of our products and services to these customers.adverse economic conditions
        could result in financial difficulties or bankruptcy for any of our suppliers,
        which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.the significant
        downturn in worldwide economic conditions and credit tightening could present
        challenges to our suppliers, which could result in disruptions to our business,
        increase our costs, delay shipment of our products or delivery of services
        and impair our ability to generate and recognize revenue. to address their
        own business challenges, our suppliers may increase prices, reduce the availability
        of credit, require deposits or advance payments or take other actions that
        may impose a burden on us.they may also reduce production capacity, slow or
        delay delivery of products, face challenges meeting our specifications or
        otherwise fail to meet our requirements. in some cases, our suppliers may
        face bankruptcy. we may be required to identify, qualify and engage new suppliers,
        which would require time and the attention of management. any of these events
        could impair our ability to deliver our products and services to customers
        in a timely and cost-effective manner, cause us to breach our contractual
        commitments or result in the loss of customers.the purchasing and delivery
        schedules and priorities of the u.s. military and foreign governments are
        often unpredictable.we sell our fog systems and tactical navigation products
        to u.s. and foreign military and government customers, either directly or
        as a subcontractor to other contractors. these customers often use a competitive
        bidding process and have unique purchasing and delivery requirements, which
        often makes the timing of sales to these customers unpredictable. factors
        that affect their purchasing and delivery decisions include:\u2022increasing
        budgetary pressures, which may reduce or delay funding for military programs;\u2022changes
        in modernization plans for military equipment;\u2022changes in tactical navigation
        requirements;\u2022global conflicts impacting troop deployment, including
        troop withdrawals from the middle east;\u2022priorities for current battlefield
        operations;\u2022new military and operational doctrines that affect military
        equipment needs;\u2022sales cycles that are long and difficult to predict;\u2022shifting
        response time and/or delays in the approval process associated with the export
        licenses we must obtain prior to the international shipment of certain of
        our military products;\u2022delays in military procurement schedules; and\u2022delays
        in the testing and acceptance of our products, including delays resulting
        from changes in customer specifications.these factors can cause substantial
        fluctuations in sales of our tacnav and fog products from period to period.
        for example, sales of our fog products increased $0.7 million, or 3%, from
        2011 to 2012 and increased $1.1 million, or 5%, from 2012 to 2013. however,
        sales of our fog products decreased $3.0 million, or 39%, from the fourth
        quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013.  tacnav product sales, increased
        $1.0 million, or 5% from 2011 to 2012 and decreased $0.6 million, or 3% from
        2012 to 2013. tacnav service sales increased $4.8 million, or 88% from 2012
        to 2013. the increases in tacnav product sales in 2012 and service sales in
        2013 were due primarily to the $35.6 million sang order received in june 2012,
        the largest tacnav order in our history. the product shipments on the sang
        order were completed in the second quarter of 2013. the remaining $1.3 million
        in contract value for the services portion of the sang order as of december
        31, 2013 is estimated for completion in the first quarter of 2014. we do not
        currently have in backlog another order of comparable 14table of contents
        size for 2014 or future years, and as a result we expect that our tacnav service
        revenues will decline in 2014 from 2013 and our tacnav product revenue may
        decline as well in 2014.  the u.s. government may change defense spending
        priorities at any time.  moreover, government customers such as the u.s. coast
        guard and their contractors can generally cancel orders for our products for
        convenience or decline to exercise previously disclosed contract options.
        even under firm orders with government customers, funding must often be appropriated
        in the budget process in order for the government to complete the contract.
        the cancellation of or failure to fund orders for our products could further
        reduce our net sales and results of operations.sales of our fog systems and
        tacnav products generally consist of a few large orders, and the delay or
        cancellation of a single order could substantially reduce our net sales.kvh
        products sold to customers in the defense industry are purchased through orders
        that can generally range in size from several hundred thousand dollars to
        more than one million dollars. for example, we received orders for tacnav
        products and services of $7.2 million, $35.6 million and $2.8 million in january
        2013, june 2012 and june 2012, respectively. orders of this size are often
        unpredictable and difficult to replicate. as a result, the delay or cancellation
        of a single order could materially reduce our net sales and results of operations.
        we periodically experience repeated and unanticipated delays in defense orders,
        which make our revenues and operating results less predictable. because our
        guidance and stabilization products typically have relatively higher product
        gross margins than our mobile communications products, the loss of an order
        for guidance and stabilization products could have a disproportionately adverse
        effect on our results of operations.only a few customers account for a substantial
        portion of our guidance and stabilization revenues, and the loss of any of
        these customers could substantially reduce our net sales.we derive a significant
        portion of our guidance and stabilization revenues from a small number of
        customers, many of whom are contractors for the u.s. government.  for example,
        for the year ended december 31, 2013, sang accounted for approximately 12%
        of our total sales, and product deliveries to this customer under our existing
        contract were completed in the second quarter. we do not currently have in
        backlog another order of comparable size for 2014 or future years. the loss
        of business from any of these customers could substantially reduce our net
        sales and results of operations and could seriously harm our business. since
        we are often awarded a contract as a subcontractor to a major defense supplier
        that is engaged in a competitive bidding process as prime contractor for a
        major weapons procurement program, our revenues depend significantly on the
        success of the prime contractors with which we align ourselves.commercial
        sales of our guidance and stabilization products are unpredictable.increased
        commercial sales of our guidance and stabilization products are making it
        more difficult to predict our future revenues.  we have been marketing our
        guidance and stabilization products, particularly our fogs, to original equipment
        manufacturers for incorporation into commercial products, such as navigation
        and positioning systems for various applications, including precision mapping,
        dynamic surveying, autonomous vehicles, train location control and track geometry
        measurement systems, industrial robotics and optical stabilization.  because
        we sell these products to original equipment manufacturers rather than end-users,
        we have less information about market trends and other developments affecting
        the buying patterns of end-users and, as a result, may be unable to forecast
        demand for these products accurately.  moreover, sales of these products for
        commercial applications depend on the success of our customers\u2019 products,
        and any decline in sales of our customers\u2019 products would reduce demand
        for our products.our mobile satellite products currently depend on satellite
        services and facilities provided by third parties, and a disruption in those
        services could adversely affect sales.our satellite antenna products include
        the equipment necessary to utilize satellite services; we do not own the satellites
        to directly provide two-way satellite communications. we currently offer satellite
        television products compatible with the directv and dish network services
        in the united states, the bell tv service in canada, the sky mexico service
        and various other regional satellite tv services in other parts of the world.ses,
        eutelsat, sky perfect-jsat, telesat, echostar, intelsat and star one currently
        provide the satellite capacity to support the mini-vsat broadband service
        and our tracphone v-series products. intelsat also currently provides our
        c-band satellite coverage. in addition, we have agreements with various teleports
        and internet service providers around the globe to support the mini-vsat broadband
        service. we rely on inmarsat for satellite communications services for our
        fleetbroadband compatible tracphone products.if customers become dissatisfied
        with the programming, pricing, service, availability or other aspects of any
        of these satellite services, or if any one or more of these services becomes
        unavailable for any reason, we could suffer a substantial decline in sales
        of our satellite products. there may be no alternative service provider available
        in a particular geographic area, and our modem or other technology may not
        be compatible with the technology of any alternative service provider that
        may be 15table of contents available. in addition, the unexpected failure
        of a satellite could disrupt the availability of programming and services,
        which could reduce the demand for, or customer satisfaction with, our products.we
        rely upon spread spectrum communications technology developed by viasat and
        transmitted by third-party satellite providers to permit two-way broadband
        internet via our 60-cm diameter tracphone v7 antenna, our 37-cm diameter tracphone
        v3 antenna, and our 1.1-meter diameter tracphone v11, and any disruption in
        the availability of this technology could adversely affect sales.our mini-vsat
        broadband service relies on spread spectrum technology developed with viasat,
        inc., for use with satellite capacity controlled by ses, eutelsat, sky perfect-jsat,
        telesat, echostar, intelsat and star one. our tracphone two-way broadband
        satellite terminals combine our stabilized antenna technology with viasat\u2019s
        arclight spread spectrum mobile broadband technology, along with viasat\u2019s
        arclight spread spectrum modem. the arclight technology is also integrated
        within the satellite hubs that support this service. sales of the tracphone
        v-series products and our mini-vsat broadband service could be disrupted if
        we fail to receive approval from regulatory authorities to provide our spread
        spectrum service in the waters of various countries where our customers operate
        or if there are issues with the availability of the arclight maritime modems.high
        fuel prices, tight credit availability, environmental concerns and ongoing
        low levels of consumer confidence are adversely affecting sales of our mobile
        satellite tv products.factors such as high fuel prices, tight credit, environmental
        protection laws and ongoing low levels of consumer confidence can materially
        and adversely affect sales of larger vehicles and vessels for which our mobile
        satellite tv products are designed. many customers finance their purchases
        of these vehicles and vessels, and tightened credit availability can reduce
        demand for both these vehicles and vessels and our mobile satellite tv products.
        moreover, in the current credit markets, financing for these purchases has
        sometimes been unavailable or more difficult to obtain. the increased cost
        of operating these vehicles and vessels can adversely affect demand for our
        mobile satellite tv products.we may continue to increase the use of international
        suppliers to source components for our manufacturing operations, which could
        disrupt our business.although we have historically manufactured and sourced
        raw materials for the majority of our products domestically, in order for
        us to compete with lower priced competitive products while also improving
        our profitability, in some instances we have found it desirable to source
        raw materials and manufactured components and assemblies from europe, asia
        and south america. reliance on foreign manufacturing and/or raw material supply
        has lengthened our supply chain and increased the risk that a disruption in
        that supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operations and
        financial performance.we have single dedicated manufacturing facilities for
        each of our mobile communications and guidance and stabilization product categories,
        and any significant disruption to a facility could impair our ability to deliver
        our products.excluding the commbox product, which we manufacture in norway,
        we currently manufacture all of our mobile communications products at our
        manufacturing facility in middletown, rhode island, and the majority of our
        guidance and stabilization products at our facility in tinley park, illinois.
        some of our production processes are complex, and we may be unable to respond
        rapidly to the loss of the use of either production facility. for example,
        our production facilities use some specialized equipment that may take time
        to replace if they are damaged or become unusable for any reason. in that
        event, shipments would be delayed, which could result in customer or dealer
        dissatisfaction, loss of sales and damage to our reputation. finally, we have
        only a limited capability to increase our manufacturing capacity in the short
        term. if short-term demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity,
        our inability to fulfill orders in a timely manner could also lead to customer
        or dealer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and damage to our reputation.we depend
        on sole or limited source suppliers, and any disruption in supply could impair
        our ability to deliver our products on time or at expected cost.we obtain
        many key components for our products from third-party suppliers, and in some
        cases we use a single or a limited number of suppliers. any interruption in
        supply could impair our ability to deliver our products until we identify
        and qualify a new source of supply, which could take several weeks, months
        or longer and could increase our costs significantly. suppliers might change
        or discontinue key components, which could require us to modify our product
        designs. for example, in the past, we have experienced changes in the chemicals
        used to coat our optical fiber, which changed its characteristics and thereby
        necessitated design modifications. department of defense regulations requiring
        government contractors to implement processes to avoid counterfeit parts may
        require us to find new sources of materials or components if the current supplier
        cannot meet the requirements. in general, we do not have written long-term
        supply agreements with our suppliers but instead 16table of contents purchase
        components through purchase orders, which expose us to potential price increases
        and termination of supply without notice or recourse. it is generally not
        our practice to carry significant inventories of product components, and this
        could magnify the impact of the loss of a supplier. if we are required to
        use a new source of materials or components, it could also result in unexpected
        manufacturing difficulties and could affect product performance and reliability.
        in addition, from time to time, lead times for certain components can increase
        significantly due to imbalances in overall market supply and demand. this,
        in turn, could limit our ability to satisfy the demand for certain of our
        products on a timely basis, and could result in some customer orders being
        rescheduled or canceled.any failure to maintain and expand our third-party
        distribution relationships may limit our ability to penetrate markets for
        mobile communications products and services.we market and sell our mobile
        communications products and services through an international network of independent
        retailers, chain stores and distributors, as well as to manufacturers of marine
        vessels, recreational vehicles and buses. if we are unable to maintain or
        improve our distribution relationships, it could significantly limit our sales.
        some of our distribution relationships are new, and our new distributors may
        not be successful in marketing and selling our products and services. in addition,
        our distribution partners may sell products of other companies, including
        competing products, and are generally not required to purchase minimum quantities
        of our products.our new media and entertainment business relies on licensing
        arrangements with content providers, and the loss of or changes in those arrangements
        could adversely affect our business.we distribute premium news, sports, movies
        and music content for commercial and leisure customers in the maritime, hotel,
        and retail markets.  we do not generate this content but instead license the
        content from third parties on a non-exclusive basis.  we do not have long-term
        license agreements with any content provider.  accordingly, any content provider
        could terminate our existing arrangements with little or no advance notice
        or could adversely modify the terms of the arrangement, including potential
        price increases.  the loss of content could adversely affect the attractiveness
        of our media and entertainment offerings, which could adversely affect our
        revenues.  any increase in the cost of content could reduce the profitability
        of these offerings.if we are unable to improve our existing mobile communications
        and guidance and stabilization products and develop new, innovative products,
        our sales and market share may decline.the markets for mobile communications
        products and guidance and stabilization products are each characterized by
        rapid technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer
        requirements and expectations, and evolving industry standards. if we fail
        to make innovations in our existing products and reduce the costs of our products,
        our market share may decline. products using new technologies, or emerging
        industry standards, could render our products obsolete. if our competitors
        successfully introduce new or enhanced products that eliminate technological
        advantages our products may have in a market or otherwise outperform our products,
        or are perceived by consumers as doing so, we may be unable to compete successfully
        in the markets affected by these changes.if we cannot effectively manage changes
        in our rate of growth, our business may suffer.we have previously expanded
        our operations to pursue existing and potential market opportunities, and
        we are continuing to expand our international operations. for example, we
        recently opened a new sales office in japan to service local customers, and
        we recently expanded our service offerings through the acquisition of headland
        media limited (now known as the kvh media group). this growth placed a strain
        on our personnel, management, financial and other resources. if any portion
        of our business grows more rapidly than we anticipate and we fail to manage
        that growth properly, we may incur unnecessary expenses, and the efficiency
        of our operations may decline. if we are unable to adjust our operating expenses
        on a timely basis in response to changes in revenue cycles, our results of
        operations may be harmed. to manage changes in our rate of growth effectively,
        we must, among other things:\u2022match our manufacturing facilities and capacity
        to demand for our products in a timely manner;\u2022successfully attract,
        train, motivate and manage appropriate numbers of employees for manufacturing,
        sales and customer support activities;\u2022effectively manage our inventory
        and working capital; and\u2022improve the efficiencies within our operating,
        administrative, financial and accounting systems, and our procedures and controls.17table
        of contents we identified a material weakness in our internal control over
        financial reporting as of december 31, 2012, and the occurrence of this or
        any other material weakness could have a material adverse effect on our ability
        to report accurate financial information in a timely manner.as previously
        described in item 9a of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended
        december 31, 2012, in march 2013, our management identified that the most
        senior member of our accounting staff at our danish subsidiary had engaged
        in a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate assets from us over a period of at
        least three years. the scheme included fraudulent wire transfers to a personal
        bank account, fraudulent documentation, forged signatures and use of a corporate
        credit card for personal expenses.  management performed its assessment of
        the effectiveness of our internal control over financing reporting as of december
        31, 2012 and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
        as of that date was not effective because of a material weakness.  that assessment
        identified three control deficiencies in our internal control over financial
        reporting. after implementation of a remediation plan, management concluded
        that, as of december 31, 2013, the control deficiencies had been remediated.   if
        we were to have a material weakness in our internal control over financial
        reporting, it is possible that our financial statements would not comply with
        generally accepted accounting principles, would contain a material misstatement
        or would not be available on a timely basis, any of which could cause investors
        to lose confidence in us and lead to, among other things, unanticipated legal,
        accounting and other expenses, delays in filing required financial disclosures,
        enforcement actions by government authorities, fines, penalties, the delisting
        of our common stock and liabilities arising from stockholder litigation.we
        may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel we need to expand our
        operations.to meet our growth objectives, we must attract and retain highly
        skilled technical, operational, managerial and sales and marketing personnel.
        if we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, we may be unable
        to achieve our business objectives and may lose our competitive position,
        which could lead to a significant decline in net sales. we face significant
        competition for these skilled professionals from other companies, research
        and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.our
        success depends on the services of our executive officers.our future success
        depends to a significant degree on the skills and efforts of martin kits van
        heyningen, our co-founder, president, chief executive officer, and chairman
        of the board. if we lost the services of mr.\u00a0kits van heyningen, our
        business and operating results could be seriously harmed. we also depend on
        the ability of our other executive officers to work effectively as a team.
        the loss of one or more of our executive officers could impair our ability
        to manage our business effectively.our international business operations expose
        us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our activities abroad and in
        dealing with multiple regulatory environments.historically, sales to customers
        outside the united states and canada have accounted for a significant portion
        of our net sales, and our acquisition of headland media limited (now known
        as the kvh media group) in may 2013 increased our sales in new foreign markets.
        we have foreign sales offices in denmark, the united kingdom, singapore, japan,
        norway and cyprus, as well as a subsidiary in brazil that manages local sales.
        we otherwise support our international sales from our operations in the united
        states. our limited operations in foreign countries may impair our ability
        to compete successfully in international markets and to meet the service and
        support needs of our customers in countries where we have little to no infrastructure.
        we are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business
        activities, which may increase our costs and require significant management
        attention. these risks include:\u2022technical challenges we may face in adapting
        our mobile communications products to function with different satellite services
        and technology in use in various regions around the world;\u2022satisfaction
        of international regulatory requirements and delays and costs associated with
        procurement of any necessary licenses or permits;\u2022restrictions on the
        sale of certain guidance and stabilization products to foreign military and
        government customers;\u2022increased costs of providing customer support in
        multiple languages;\u2022increased costs of managing operations that are international
        in scope;\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions
        on the repatriation of earnings;18table of contents \u2022protectionist laws
        and business practices that favor local competitors, which could slow our
        growth in international markets;\u2022potentially longer sales cycles, which
        could slow our revenue growth from international sales;\u2022potentially longer
        accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts
        receivable;\u2022losses arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
        and\u2022economic and political instability in some international markets.exports
        of certain guidance and stabilization products are subject to the u.s. export
        administration regulations and the international traffic in arms regulations
        and require a license from the u.s. department of state prior to shipment.we
        must comply with the united states export administration regulations and the
        international traffic in arms regulations, or itar. certain of our products
        have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the
        itar and require an individual validated license in order to be exported to
        certain jurisdictions. any changes in export regulations or reclassifications
        of our products may further restrict the export of our products, and we may
        cease to be able to procure export licenses for our products under existing
        regulations. the length of time required by the licensing process can vary,
        potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding
        revenue. any restriction on the export of a product line or any amount of
        our products could cause a significant reduction in net sales.our business
        may suffer if we cannot protect our proprietary technology.our ability to
        compete depends significantly upon our patents, our source code and our other
        proprietary technology. the steps we have taken to protect our technology
        may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology
        to compete with us. our patents could expire or be challenged, invalidated
        or circumvented, and the rights we have under our patents could provide no
        competitive advantages. existing trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws
        offer only limited protection. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries
        do not protect our proprietary technology to the same extent as the laws of
        the united states, which could increase the likelihood of misappropriation.
        furthermore, other companies could independently develop similar or superior
        technology without violating our intellectual property rights. any misappropriation
        of our technology or the development of competing technology could seriously
        harm our competitive position, which could lead to a substantial reduction
        in net sales.if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual
        property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome, disruptive and expensive,
        distract the attention of management, and there can be no assurance that we
        would prevail.also, we have delivered certain technical data and information
        to the u.s. government under procurement contracts, and it may have unlimited
        rights to use that technical data and information. there can be no assurance
        that the u.s. government will not authorize others to use that data and information
        to compete with us.claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property
        rights could harm our business and financial condition.our industries are
        characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims
        and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.
        we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued
        patents, patents that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual property
        rights of others.we do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to
        determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held
        by third parties. in addition, product development is inherently uncertain
        in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous
        patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with
        regard to similar technologies.from time to time we have faced claims by third
        parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual
        property rights, and we may face similar claims in the future. any claim of
        infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the
        claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract the attention of our
        management. if any of our products are found to violate third-party proprietary
        rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. in addition, we may
        be required to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses from third parties
        to continue to offer our products. any efforts to re-engineer our products
        or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful,
        which would prevent us from selling our products, and, in any case, could
        substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our
        business, financial condition and results of operations.19table of contents
        cybersecurity breaches could expose us to liability, damage our reputation,
        require us to incur significant costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial
        results.we retain sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary
        business information and personally identifiable information of our employees
        and customers on our computer networks.  although we take protective measures
        and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, invasive technologies
        and techniques continue to evolve rapidly, and our computer systems, software
        and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses
        or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact.  any
        security breach may compromise information stored on our networks and may
        result in significant data losses or theft of our, our customers'', our business
        partners'' or our employees'' intellectual property, proprietary business
        information or personally identifiable information.if any of these events
        were to occur, they could lead to the loss of sensitive information, cause
        us to lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers, as well as
        subject us to regulatory actions, litigation, fines or damage to our reputation,
        and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
        of operations or cash flows.fluctuations in our quarterly net sales and results
        of operations could depress the market price of our common stock.we have at
        times experienced significant fluctuations in our net sales and results of
        operations from one quarter to the next. our future net sales and results
        of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number
        of factors, many of which are outside our control. accordingly, you should
        not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as
        an indication of future performance. it is possible that our net sales or
        results of operations in a quarter will fall below the expectations of securities
        analysts or investors. if this occurs, the market price of our common stock
        could fall significantly. our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate
        for many reasons, including:\u2022changes in demand for our mobile communications
        products and services and guidance and stabilization products and services;\u2022the
        timing and size of individual orders from military customers;\u2022the mix
        of products we sell;\u2022our ability to manufacture, test and deliver products
        in a timely and cost-effective manner, including the availability and timely
        delivery of components and subassemblies from our suppliers;\u2022our success
        in winning competitions for orders;\u2022the timing of new product introductions
        by us or our competitors;\u2022expense incurred in pursuing acquisitions;\u2022market
        and competitive pricing pressures;\u2022general economic climate; and\u2022seasonality
        of pleasure boat and recreational vehicle usage.a large portion of our expenses,
        including expenses for network infrastructure, facilities, equipment, and
        personnel, are relatively fixed. accordingly, if our net sales decline or
        do not grow as much as we anticipate, we might be unable to maintain or improve
        our operating margins. any failure to achieve anticipated net sales could
        therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal
        period.we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively
        impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow.we are subject to
        income taxes and other taxes in both the u.s. and the foreign jurisdictions
        in which we currently operate. the determination of our worldwide provision
        for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires
        judgment and estimation. in the ordinary course of our business, there are
        many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is
        uncertain. we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and
        foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of
        changing tax regulations and legislation. although we believe our tax estimates
        are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax
        amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially
        affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows
        in the period in which such determination is made.deferred tax assets are
        recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
        between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and
        for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. a valuation allowance
        reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which assumes that
        it is more likely than not that we will be 20table of contents able to generate
        sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value. we review
        our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. as part
        of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative
        results in recent years.if, during our quarterly reviews of our deferred tax
        assets, we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not be able
        to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value
        of our deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce
        the tax assets to estimated realizable value. this could result in a material
        income tax charge.the market price of our common stock may be volatile.our
        stock price has historically been volatile. during the period from january\u00a01,
        2012 to december 31, 2013, the trading price of our common stock ranged from
        $7.61 to $15.00. many factors may cause the market price of our common stock
        to fluctuate, including:\u2022variations in our quarterly results of operations;\u2022the
        introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors;\u2022changing
        needs of military customers;\u2022changes in estimates of our performance
        or recommendations by securities analysts;\u2022the hiring or departure of
        key personnel;\u2022acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our
        competitors;\u2022market conditions in our industries; and\u2022the global
        macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.in addition, the stock market can
        experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. major stock market indices
        experienced dramatic declines in 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009. these
        fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular
        companies. these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market
        price of our common stock. when the market price of a company\u2019s stock
        drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities litigation against
        that company. any such litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses
        defending against the claim, divert the time and attention of our management
        and result in significant damages.compliance with the sec''s new conflict
        minerals rules will increase our costs and adversely affect our results of
        operations.we are subject to the sec''s new disclosure requirements for public
        companies that manufacture, or contract to manufacture, products for which
        certain minerals and their derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten and
        gold, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d are necessary to the functionality
        or production of those products.  these regulations will require us to determine
        which of our products contain conflict minerals and, if so, to perform an
        extensive inquiry into our supply chain in an effort to determine whether
        or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo,
        or drc, or an adjoining country.  we expect to incur additional costs to comply
        with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining
        the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products, which will
        adversely affect our results of operations.  because our supply chain is complex,
        the country of origin inquiry and due diligence procedures that we implement
        may not enable us to ascertain the origins of any conflict minerals that we
        use or determine that these minerals did not originate from the drc or an
        adjoining country, which may harm our reputation.  we may also face difficulties
        in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as
        drc conflict-free, which could harm our relationships with these customers
        and lead to a loss of revenue.  these new requirements could also have the
        effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals,
        and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices,
        which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations
        and our profitability.21table of contents acquisitions may disrupt our operations
        or adversely affect our results.we evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities
        to acquire other businesses as they arise, such as our acquisition of headland
        media limited (now known as the kvh media group) in may 2013. the expenses
        we incur evaluating and pursuing this and other such acquisitions could have
        a material adverse effect on our results of operations. for example, we incurred
        approximately $0.9 million in connection with the acquisition of the kvh media
        group. if we acquire a business, we may be unable to manage it profitably
        or successfully integrate its operations with our own. moreover, we may be
        unable to realize the strategic, financial, operational and other benefits
        we anticipate from any acquisition. competition for acquisition opportunities
        could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce
        the number of potential acquisition targets. further, our approach to acquisitions
        may involve a number of special financial and business risks, such as:\u2022entry
        into new and unfamiliar lines of business or markets, which may present challenges
        or risks that we did not anticipate;\u2022charges related to any potential
        acquisition from which we may withdraw;\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s
        time, attention, and resources;\u2022loss of key acquired personnel;\u2022increased
        costs to improve or coordinate managerial, operational, financial, and administrative
        systems, including compliance with the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002;\u2022dilutive
        issuances of equity securities;\u2022the assumption of legal liabilities;
        and\u2022losses arising from impairment charges associated with goodwill or
        intangible assets.our charter and by-laws and delaware law may deter takeovers.our
        certificate of incorporation, by-laws and delaware law contain provisions
        that could have an anti-takeover effect and discourage, delay or prevent a
        change in control or an acquisition that many stockholders may find attractive.
        these provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult
        for our stockholders to take some corporate actions, including the election
        of directors. these provisions relate to:\u2022the ability of our board of
        directors to issue preferred stock, and determine its terms, without a stockholder
        vote;\u2022the classification of our board of directors, which effectively
        prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one
        annual meeting of stockholders;\u2022the limitation that directors may be
        removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds
        of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote;\u2022the prohibition against
        stockholder actions by written consent;\u2022the inability of stockholders
        to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\u2022advance notice requirements
        for stockholder proposals and director nominations.", "permalink_id": "352c46147ced121e445f737b5d557cfa",

        to the labrador claims.\\n\\nhistory of labrador and the labrador claims \\naccording
        to the report prepared by our consulting\\ngeophysicist, the geologic setting
        is based on information available from the\\ngeological survey of canada (dnr
        open file 013f/0055) and the government of\\nnewfoundland and labrador (open
        file 013f/0061). the regional geology as\\ndescribed by both government reports
        contains very little detail because the\\ntrans-labrador highway was under
        construction during much of the mapping\\ninitiative, opening in 1992. \\nalso,
        the area has seen only limited geologic mapping on a\\nregional scale, in
        part due to the remoteness of the area and the timing of the\\nfederal and
        provincial mapping initiatives that preceded construction of the\\ntrans-labrador
        highway. the mapped geology within the area is part of a regional\\n1:500,000
        compilation undertaken by the newfoundland and labrador provincial\\ngovernment
        during the early 1990\u0092s. the survey area is located outside of the\\narea
        of detailed mapping, in which case geologic mapping has been taken from\\nprevious
        publications, most notably a federal government regional mapping\\nprogram
        from 1990-1994. during the period 1990 to 1994 the area was regionally\\nmapped
        by the geological survey of canada and by the mines and energy branch of\\nthe
        newfoundland and labrador government. geologic mapping was performed on a\\nvery
        regional scale, due in part to the remoteness of the area (away from the\\ntrans-labrador
        highway) and the lack of outcrop. in summary there is very little\\ngeological
        mapping within the survey area and there has never been a detailed\\nmapping
        program. \\n7 \\n\\n\\nexploration history \\nin the fall of 2007 wolverine
        completed an airborne survey of\\nthe labrador claims. the airborne survey
        identified 8 conductive targets that\\nwarrant ground follow-up.\\nin the
        fall of 2009 wolverine carried out geological\\nreconnaissance along with
        prospecting and sampling on three of its eleven\\nlabrador licenses. some,
        but not all of the known mineralized zones were sampled\\nas this was more
        of a reconnaissance exercise until a more systematic program is\\nput in place.
        in addition, to the usual base metal sampling, scintillometer\\nsurveys were
        done on the exposed rock cuts along the highway and selected areas\\nof the
        southern portions of the three licenses. \\nwork on the property during june
        of 2010 consisted of\\nprospecting, sampling and geological reconnaissance
        on and around\\nelectro-magnetic and radiometric anomalies that were identified
        during the 2007\\nairborne survey. earlier sampling on rock cuts along the
        highway had shown\\nvalues in cu and au that warranted further exploration.
        \\ncontinued prospecting during july 2010 on other areas of the\\nproperty
        has revealed additional outcrops containing malachite alteration on the\\nwestern
        end of the property near anomaly number one.\\nin august and september 2010
        a follow up program of diamond\\ndrilling was contracted to an ontario drilling
        company and a total of 522.5\\nmeters was drilled in 6 holes.\\nin november
        and december 2010 an induced polarization (ip)\\nsurvey was completed on the
        property. the survey was conducted on two grids\\nlocated on the property.
        grid 1 consisted of 19, 1.6 km lines oriented at 360\\ndegrees. 5 of those
        lines were cut short (1.2 km) due to a large lake that was\\nnot completely
        frozen at the time of the survey and was considered unsafe. a 1.8\\nkm base
        line oriented at 090 degrees crossed the centre of the grid. grid 2\\nconsisted
        of 13 lines that varied from ~750 m, in the south to 1500 m in the\\nnorth.
        the lines were oriented at 090 degrees with a baseline 1.2 km long,\\noriented
        at 360 degrees.\\nin june of 2011 wolverine conducted a prospecting program
        which\\nmarked the eleven drill locations in the anomalous areas which were
        identified\\nby the induced polarization survey completed in late 2010. \\nin
        the fall of 2011 a follow up program of diamond drilling was\\ncontracted
        to an ontario drilling company and a total of 271 meters was drilled\\nin
        4 holes.\\nin the fall of 2012 a follow up program of diamond drilling\\nconsisting
        of two holes was drilled by innu-cartwright drilling limited\\npartnership.\\nthere
        has been no exploration on the labrador claims since\\n2012. due to the current
        lack of financing available for exploration companies,\\nexploration on these
        claims has been suspended. wolverine will continue\\nexploration on these
        claims when financing is available.\\nexploration results \\ndisseminated
        mineralization consisting mainly of pyrite,\\npyrrhotite and chalcopyrite
        were detected in several areas of the property.\\nmineralization was first
        noted in roadside rock cuts, samples were taken but the\\ngps location was
        not recorded as none were available, only a generalized\\nlocation within
        several metres was given to the geologist.\\nafter wolverine acquired the
        property an airborne survey was\\ncompleted and several anomalies were detected.
        wolverine then engaged a\\ngeologist to supervise the prospecting, trenching
        and drilling program.\\nprospecting revealed other zones of disseminated mineralization,
        mainly in rock\\ncuts along the highway which had the best exposure as most
        of the property is\\ncovered by marsh and forested overburden. \\n8 \\n\\n\\ndiamond
        drilling on two airborne anomalous areas revealed\\ndisseminated mineralization
        in four of the six drill holes.\\nwolverine then conducted an induced polarization
        (ip) survey on\\ntwo selected areas that detected 23 anomalous zones. plans
        are underway to\\nconduct an additional drill program to test the strongest
        areas later this\\nspring. \\nof the four holes drilled in the fall of 2011,
        two had minor\\nindications of sulphide mineralization with magnetite while
        one contained\\ndisseminated mineralization consisting of blebs of chalcopyrite
        and pyrite for\\napproximately 37 metres (121 feet).\\nthe two anomalies drilled
        in the fall of 2012 at approximately\\n50 degree angles did not intersect
        sufficient amounts of mineralization to\\naccount for the magnitude of that
        picked up by the ip survey. there are very\\nminor amounts of pyrite and the
        rock is slightly magnetic with only background\\nradioactivity. \\nthere has
        been no exploration on the labrador claims since\\n2012. due to the current
        lack of financing available for exploration companies,\\nexploration on these
        claims has been suspended. wolverine will continue\\nexploration on these
        claims when financing is available.\\nquality assurance/quality control \\nall
        drill core samples were cut lengthwise with a rock saw.\\nhalf of the sample
        was retained for future reference and the other was sent by\\ncanada post,
        insured and delivered to the laboratory. sample sections were\\nmeasured by
        depth markers in the core boxes and confirmed by the geologist.\\nresults
        were mailed back to the geologist and confirmed by the chief chemist\u0092s\\nsignature.
        a portion of the laboratory sample was retained at the laboratory for\\na
        period of one year. \\nsurface bedrock sample sites were selected by geologists
        and\\nprospectors. gps readings recorded the locations. samples were stored
        in new\\nindustrial plastic sample bags with the sample number which was also
        recorded in\\nnote books. samples were again sent by canada post with the
        same procedure noted\\nabove. \\npresent condition of the labrador claims
        \\nthe mineralization found to date on the labrador claims\\nconsists primarily
        of copper and gold mineralization in sulphide with associated\\npyrite (a
        non-economic sulphide mineral). there are also a number of malachite\\nveins
        (and malachite stained outcrops). \\nthe country rocks have been identified
        as meta-sedimentary\\ngneiss. locally gabbros and diorites have been identified
        by surface\\nprospecting. \\nbased on the mineralization and the known geologic
        rock types,\\nthere appear to be three possible deposit types that could host
        mineralization\\nwithin the labrador claims; 1) porphyry copper-gold in sulphide,
        2) volcanogenic\\n(cu-pb-zn) massive sulphide, or 3) magmatic nickel-copper
        sulphide. \\ncopper-gold (cu-au) deposits occur within sedimentary rocks\\nwhen
        a stock intrudes into the sediments and heats up the ground water. the\\nheated
        fluids pick up copper and other metals as they percolate through\\nfractures
        opened up within the sediments. mineralization is mostly disseminated,\\nbut
        significant veins of chalcopyrite, rich in gold, are also present. the\\npresence
        of chalcopyrite in meta-sediment and malachite staining are excellent\\nindicators
        for a copper-gold system. \\nvms deposits are commonly formed by deposition
        of hot metals\\ninto seawater from volcanic vents on the seafloor. the main
        metals include\\ncopper, zinc, lead, gold and silver. within the labrador
        claims there are no\\nmapped volcanic rocks, although the known mineralization
        has been found within\\ngabbro and diorite. \\nmagmatic nickel-copper sulphide
        deposits are hosted in mafic to\\nultramafic rocks such as gabbro, norite,
        and troctolite. other rock types\\ncommonly associated with these host rocks
        are diorites and anorthosites. within\\nthe labrador claims chalcopyrite mineralization
        was identified in a gabbro and\\nseparately associated with a diorite dyke.
        \\n9 \\n\\n\\nthe labrador claims are almost completely covered by overburden\\nand
        tree cover. rock outcrops are best observed along the highway where they\\nhave
        been uncovered. \\nthe climate within the area is typically northern with
        short\\nhot summers and long cold winters. winter temperatures can range from
        -15o c to\\n-35o c and occasionally fall to below -42o c. \\nthere is no equipment,
        infrastructure or electricity currently\\non the labrador claims. \\nthere
        have been no previous airborne surveys in this area that\\nare within 35 kilometers
        (22 miles) of the labrador claims. the area would have\\nbeen covered as part
        of the federal government regional airborne magnetic\\nsurvey, but this survey
        would not have the sufficient resolution to identify\\nmagnetic units less
        than 1 kilometer in size and could not detect any conductive\\nmineralization.
        \\ngeology of the labrador claims \\ngeologically the area is mapped as early
        to late proterozoic\\nmeta-sediments that have been metamorphosed to gneisses.
        major gabbroic and\\nanorthositic intrusives have intruded the gneisses several
        kilometers to the\\neast and local gabbros and diorites occur throughout the
        area along with several\\nquartz veins. large tourmaline crystals have also
        been identified on the\\nlabrador claims. the area has little outcrop and
        is covered by overburden,\\ngenerally sand and gravel. spruces trees are abundant
        but are not very tall.\\n\\nthe presence of several copper showings and malachite
        staining\\nin the limited outcrop suggests that a mineralizing event of copper
        and gold has\\nintruded into the meta-sedimentary rocks. the nature of the
        mineralization is\\nlikely to be copper veins and disseminations with associated
        gold. it is also\\npossible that magmatic nickel and copper mineralization
        could be present with\\nassociated platinum group elements within gabbros.
        \\nthe eureka project claims \\nthe eureka project claims, with a total area
        of 3,910.67\\nhectares (9,663.5 acres), are immediately adjacent to the wingdam

        business plan\\nwill fail. \\nour current operating funds are insufficient
        to complete the\\nnext phases of our proposed exploration program on our labrador
        mineral claims.\\nwe will need to obtain additional financing in order to
        complete our business\\nplan and our proposed exploration program. our business
        plan calls for\\nsignificant expenses in connection with the exploration of
        the labrador claims.\\nwe have not made arrangements to secure any additional
        financing.\\nbecause we have only recently commenced business operations,\\nwe
        face a high risk of business failure and this could result in a total loss
        of\\nyour investment. \\nwe recently begun the initial stages of exploration
        of the\\nlabrador claims, and thus has no way to evaluate the likelihood whether
        our\\ncompany will be able to operate our business successfully. our company
        was\\nincorporated on february 23, 2006 and to date we have been involved
        primarily in\\norganizational activities, obtaining financing and preliminary
        exploration of\\nthe labrador claims. we have not earned any revenues and
        we have never achieved\\nprofitability as of the date of this annual report.
        potential investors should\\nbe aware of the difficulties normally encountered
        by new mineral exploration\\ncompanies and the high rate of failure of such
        enterprises. the likelihood of\\nsuccess must be considered in the light of
        problems, expenses, difficulties,\\ncomplications and delays encountered in
        connection with the exploration of the\\nmineral properties that our company
        plans to undertake. these potential problems\\ninclude, but are not limited
        to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration\\nand additional costs
        and expenses that may exceed current estimates. we have no\\nhistory upon
        which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that its business\\nwill
        prove successful, and we can provide no assurance to investors that our\\ncompany
        will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable\\noperations.
        if our company is unsuccessful in addressing these risks its\\nbusiness will
        likely fail and you will lose your entire investment in this\\noffering.\\n12
        \\n\\n\\nbecause our company has only recently commenced business\\noperations,
        we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nour company
        has never earned any revenue and our company has\\nnever been profitable.
        prior to completing exploration on the labrador claims,\\nwe may incur increased
        operating expenses without realizing any revenues from\\nthe labrador claims,
        this could cause our company to fail and you will lose your\\nentire investment
        in this offering.\\nif we do not find a joint venture partner for the continued\\ndevelopment
        of our mineral claims, we may not be able to advance exploration\\nwork. \\nif
        the results of the exploration program are successful, we\\nmay try to enter
        into a joint venture agreement with a partner for the further\\nexploration
        and possible production of the labrador claims. our company would\\nface competition
        from other junior mineral resource exploration companies who\\nhave properties
        that they deem to be attractive in terms of potential return and\\ninvestment
        cost. in addition, if our company entered into a joint venture\\nagreement,
        our company would likely assign a percentage of our interest in the\\nlabrador
        claims to the joint venture partner. if our company is unable to enter\\ninto
        a joint venture agreement with a partner, our company may fail and you may\\nlose
        your entire investment in this offering.\\nbecause of the speculative nature
        of mineral property\\nexploration, there is substantial risk that no commercially
        viable deposits will\\nbe found and our business will fail. \\nexploration
        for base and precious metals is a speculative\\nventure involving substantial
        risk. we can provide investors with no assurance\\nthat the labrador claims
        contain commercially viable mineral deposits. the\\nexploration program that
        our company will conduct on the labrador claims may not\\nresult in the discovery
        of commercial viable mineral deposits. problems such as\\nunusual and unexpected
        rock formations and other conditions are involved in base\\nand precious metal
        exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration\\nefforts. in such
        a case, we may be unable to complete our business plan and you\\ncould lose
        your entire investment.\\nbecause of the inherent dangers involved in base
        and\\nprecious metal exploration, there is a risk that our company may incur
        liability\\nor damages as we conducts our business. \\nthe search for base
        and precious metals involves numerous\\nhazards. as a result, our company
        may become subject to liability for such\\nhazards, including pollution, cave-ins
        and other hazards against which we cannot\\ninsure or against which we may
        elect not to insure. our company currently has no\\nsuch insurance nor do
        we expect to get such insurance in the foreseeable future.\\nif a hazard were
        to occur, the costs of rectifying the hazard may exceed our\\nasset value
        and cause our company to liquidate all of our assets resulting in\\nthe loss
        of your entire investment.\\nbecause access to our company\u0092s mineral
        claims is often\\nrestricted by inclement weather, we will be delayed in exploration
        and any\\nfuture mining efforts. \\naccess to the labrador mineral claims
        is restricted to the\\nperiod between may and november of each year due to
        snow in the area. as a\\nresult, any attempts to visit, test, or explore the
        property are largely limited\\nto these few months of the year when weather
        permits such activities. these\\nlimitations can result in significant delays
        in exploration efforts, as well as\\nmining and production in the event that
        commercial amounts of minerals are\\nfound. such delays can result in our
        company\u0092s inability to meet deadlines for\\nexploration expenditures
        as defined by the province of newfoundland and\\nlabrador. this could cause
        the business venture to fail and the loss of your\\nentire investment unless
        our company can meet the deadlines.\\n13 \\n\\n\\nas our company undertakes
        exploration of the labrador\\nclaims, we will be subject to compliance with
        government regulation that may\\nincrease the anticipated time and cost of
        its exploration program. \\nthere are several governmental regulations that
        materially\\nrestrict the exploration of minerals. our company will be subject
        to the mining\\nlaws and regulations as contained in the mineral act of the
        province of\\nnewfoundland and labrador as we carry out our exploration program.
        we may be\\nrequired to obtain work permits, post bonds and perform remediation
        work for any\\nphysical disturbance to the land in order to comply with these
        regulations.\\nwhile our company\u0092s planned exploration program budgets
        for regulatory\\ncompliance, there is a risk that new regulations could increase
        our time and\\ncosts of doing business and prevent our company from carrying
        out our\\nexploration program.\\nbecause market factors in the mining business
        are out of our\\ncontrol, our company may not be able to market any minerals
        that may be found.\\n\\nthe mining industry, in general, is intensely competitive
        and\\nwe can provide no assurance to investors even if minerals are discovered
        that a\\nready market will exist from the sale of any base or precious metals
        found.\\nnumerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability
        of base or\\nprecious metals. these factors include market fluctuations, the
        proximity and\\ncapacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment,
        government\\nregulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes,
        royalties, land\\ntenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and
        environmental\\nprotection. the exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately
        predicted,\\nbut the combination of these factors may result in our company
        not receiving an\\nadequate return on invested capital and you may lose your
        entire investment.\\nbecause our company holds a significant portion of our
        cash\\nreserves in united states dollars, we may experience weakened purchasing
        power\\nin canadian dollar terms. \\nour company holds a significant portion
        of our cash reserves in\\nunited states dollars. due to foreign exchange rate
        fluctuations, the value of\\nthese united states dollar reserves can result
        in both translation gains or\\nlosses in canadian dollar terms. if there was
        to be a significant decline in the\\nunited states dollar versus the canadian
        dollar, our us dollar purchasing power\\nin canadian dollars would also significantly
        decline. our company has not\\nentered into derivative instruments to offset
        the impact of foreign exchange\\nfluctuations.\\nour auditors have expressed
        substantial doubt about our\\ncompany\u0092s ability to continue as a going
        concern. \\nthe accompanying financial statements have been prepared\\nassuming
        that our company will continue as a going concern. as discussed in note\\n1
        to the may 31, 2013 financial statements, our company was incorporated on\\nfebruary
        23, 2006, and has never generated any revenue, has a working capital\\ndeficiency,
        and has incurred operating losses since inception. as a result, our\\ncompany\u0092s
        auditor has expressed substantial doubt about the ability of our\\ncompany
        to continue as a going concern. continued operations are dependent on\\nour
        ability to complete equity or debt financings or generate profitable\\noperations.
        such financings may not be available or may not be available on\\nreasonable
        terms. our financial statements do not include any adjustments that\\nmay
        result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\\nour stock is a penny stock.
        trading of our stock may be\\nrestricted by the sec\u0092s penny stock regulations
        which may limit a stockholder\u0092s\\nability to buy and sell our stock.\\nour
        stock is a penny stock. the securities and exchange\\ncommission has adopted
        rule 15g-9 which generally defines \u0093penny stock\u0094 to be\\nany equity
        security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per\\nshare
        or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain\\nexceptions.
        our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose\\nadditional
        sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons\\nother
        than established customers and \u0093accredited investors\u0094. the term\\n\u0093accredited
        investor\u0094 refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of\\n$5,000,000
        or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual\\nincome
        exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. the penny stock\\nrules
        require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not\\notherwise
        exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure\\ndocument
        in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny\\nstocks
        and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. the\\nbroker-dealer
        also must provide the customer with current bid and offer\\nquotations for
        the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its\\nsalesperson
        in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market\\nvalue
        of each penny stock held in the customer\u0092s account. the bid and offer\\nquotations,
        and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must\\nbe
        given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction\\nand
        must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u0092s\\nconfirmation.
        in addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a\\ntransaction in
        a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the\\nbroker-dealer must
        make a special written determination that the penny stock is\\na suitable
        investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u0092s written\\nagreement
        to the transaction. these disclosure requirements may have the effect\\nof
        reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock\\nthat
        is subject to these penny stock rules. consequently, these penny stock\\nrules
        may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. we\\nbelieve
        that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the\\nmarketability
        of our common stock. \\n14 \\n\\n\\n\\n", "permalink_id": "f30d1317c951a5dd1173f9304952eaec",
